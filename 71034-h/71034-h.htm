<p>Tom Taylor, a well set up, pleasant-faced lad
of about sixteen, came marching up the path that
led from the street to the front door of the cottage.
Tom was whistling a cheerful air; no—one
moment—the tune was cheerful enough, but Tom
Taylor was whistling it in anything but a gay
manner.</p>

<p>Something in the way that he trilled out the
notes must have impressed his mother, for she
looked up quickly, and out of the open window
near which she was sewing.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom!” she exclaimed, “you’re home
early; aren’t you? I hope——”</p>

<p>There was an anxious note in her voice, and an
extra trace of worry showed in her face, already
lined with marks of care.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am home a bit early, Mother. I’m
taking a sort of vacation you see. Came home to
get you to go for a walk. It’s too soon for supper.
Come on, we’ll walk over to the woods,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
and once again Tom tried to put some gaiety into
the tune he was whistling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor shook her head.</p>

<p>“That isn’t the reason you came home so early,
Tom,” she said, gently. “I know something has
happened. Tell me!”</p>

<p>“It isn’t anything at all, Mother, really!
Come on, we’ll go for a little walk, and then, when
we come back, I’ll help you get supper. Come
along.”</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Taylor shook her head.</p>

<p>“I’d like to come with you, Tom, you know
that,” she said, “but I must finish this dress.
Mrs. Leighton wants it to wear to-morrow, and
if it isn’t done I’ll not get paid for it, and you
know the interest is soon due. We must meet
that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” and a frown passed over the
lad’s face. “I wonder who invented interest,
anyhow. It always comes at such an inconvenient
time. Well, here’s something toward it, Mother,”
and he took from his pocket a few bills and some
change in silver.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! To-night isn’t pay night!” his
mother exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It was—for me,” he said, and this time he
smiled, for he saw a look of alarm, and almost of
fear, come over his mother’s face, and he wanted
to be as reassuring as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>“Why, Tom—Tom! if Mr. Blackford paid
you, then——”</p>

<p>“Then it’s pretty good evidence, Mother, that
I earned the money!” finished Tom with a laugh.
“You don’t often catch Mr. Blackford paying for
something he hasn’t had. I certainly earned
this!”</p>

<p>Tom sighed in memory of the long hours of
hard work he had given in exchange for that small
amount of money.</p>

<p>“But why should he pay you ahead of time,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“Because, Mother, there isn’t going to be any
more time for me at Mr. Blackford’s store—that
is not right away. I’m through—paid off, as it
were.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! I hope you didn’t have a quarrel
with him!”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, Mother. It was a plain
business proposition. He said he couldn’t afford
to hire me after school any more to do some of his
errands, and help straighten out the stock. So he
paid me what he owed me, and here I am.</p>

<p>“I quit an hour earlier, you see, though I didn’t
lose anything by it, and I thought maybe you’d
come for a walk.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to, Tom, but really I must finish this
dress. Oh, I’m so sorry Mr. Blackford couldn’t
keep you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>“So am I, Mother, particularly as we need the
money. But I think I can find something else to
do. Business is picking up a little. I’m going to
be on the lookout. Something is sure to turn up.
And I do hope it will be something worth while,
so I can, by some means or other, get enough
ahead to go to West Point.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t forgotten your ambition I see,
Tom,” said his mother, as she vigorously plied
her needle, taking advantage of the last hours of
daylight.</p>

<p>“Forgotten it, Mother? Indeed I haven’t! I
never shall. I intend to go to West Point, and become
an army officer.”</p>

<p>Tom straightened himself up as he said this, as
though he had heard the command:</p>

<p>“Attention!”</p>

<p>But the only sound that came to the ears of his
mother and himself was the distant hum and roar
of the little city, on the outskirts of which they
lived.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor sighed. Tom was folding the
bills into a neat little package, enclosing within
the silver coins. It was a small sum, but it represented
much to him and his widowed mother.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to think of you being a soldier,
Tom,” said Mrs. Taylor, as she stopped to thread
a needle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I guess there isn’t very much danger,”
Tom laughed. “There aren’t, at present, any
vacancies from this congressional district so I understand,
and the appointments at large have all
been filled. And even if there was a chance for
me to get in, I couldn’t do it I guess. It takes
about a hundred dollars to start with, but, of
course, after that Uncle Sam looks out for you.
But I sure would like to go!”</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes sparkled, and again he half unconsciously
straightened up, as stiff as the proverbial
ramrod.</p>

<p>“I wish you could have your wish, Tom,” his
mother said, softly; “but I can’t bear to think of
war. It is so cruel!”</p>

<p>“Oh, just because I want to go to West Point,
and become an army officer, doesn’t mean there’ll
be war, Mother. In fact, war is ceasing to be the
custom. But the best way not to have a war, is to
be in the finest possible shape to meet it if it does
come.”</p>

<p>“I can’t bear to think of it, Tom. The shooting—the
killing! Oh, it’s terrible!”</p>

<p>“But the United States Army does a lot of
things besides shooting and killing,” Tom said.
“Look at the officers and men—see what they’ve
done in the Panama Canal zone. Why, in spite
of the fact that they’re trained in the arts of war,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
they have, of late, been using their special knowledge
in the interests of peace. I certainly would
give anything for the chance to go to West Point.
But there! No use thinking about it!”</p>

<p>Tom seemed to blow the matter away as though
it were some trifle, light as air, and he assumed
a manner of indifference that he did not altogether
feel.</p>

<p>“Come on, Mother,” he begged, tossing the
money into her lap through the open window.
“Take a half-hour off. You’ll be all the better
for it. You haven’t been eating well lately. A
walk to the woods will give you an appetite.”</p>

<p>“I believe I will go with you, Tom,” she said,
with sudden decision. “I can finish this dress
after supper, but it must be delivered, and——”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it over,” said the lad. “I haven’t
many lessons to-night.”</p>

<p>A little later mother and son were walking
across the field that lay between their cottage and
a little patch of wood in the cool and shady depths
of which they were wont often to stroll.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor was the widow of Charles Taylor,
who was once well-to-do. He had lost his fortune
in unfortunate speculation, however, and the
shock and disappointment of this, coupled with a
not too strong constitution, caused his death when
Tom was about twelve years old.</p>

<p>From the wreck of her husband’s estate Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
Taylor received a small income, and she and Tom,
moving from the well-appointed house in the best
residential section of the small city of Chester,
took up their abode in a small cottage, once owned
by Mr. Taylor, but now mortgaged to a Mr.
Aaron Doolittle, who had, in some unexplained
manner, become possessed of much of Mr. Taylor’s
former property.</p>

<p>The crash resulting in the sweeping away of the
money, and the death of her husband, had almost
stunned the young widow. But she rallied, and
bravely took up the battle of life.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor was an expert needlewoman, and
some of her former friends kept her well supplied
with work. She managed, with a small income
from some investments her husband had
made before the crash, to keep Tom at his
studies, and, eventually, he went to the high
school, where he was in attendance when our
story opens.</p>

<p>It did not take Tom long to realize that he
was every day becoming more and more of an
expense to his widowed mother. His clothes
never seemed to wear very well. There were
certain books and other materials to buy, that he
might keep up his school work. And his appetite
was not a small one.</p>

<p>He saw the need of more money, and resolved
to earn it himself after school hours. He secured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
a place in the grocery of Mr. Blackford,
and by delivering orders, helping to keep the
stock in order, and doing the hundred and one
things that always can be done about a grocery,
he managed to add a few dollars to the weekly
income.</p>

<p>But now, owing, as Mr. Blackford had alleged,
to a desire on his part to save money, he had told
Tom his services would no longer be required.</p>

<p>“Though I’ll wager he’s found some one who
will do it more cheaply than I did,” declared
Tom. “Well, he won’t get any one to do it any
better, that’s sure. I’m going to see Wendell
to-morrow, after school. He may need a boy in
his store.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, they say he’s mean and cruel. No
one likes to work for him,” objected Mrs. Taylor.</p>

<p>“Beggars can’t be choosers,” replied the lad,
laughing. “I don’t mind hard work. I’d have
to work hard if I went to West Point.”</p>

<p>His mother smiled. She did wish her fine-looking
son could have his wish, but it seemed
out of the question. In silence the two strolled
on through the wood, to the far edge.</p>

<p>There, standing amid the trees, they could look
across a narrow valley to where a railroad embankment
wound its way along the shore of a
small river. In the distance could be seen a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
large bridge, and, crossing the river on this, the
S. &amp; C. V. Railroad entered the village of Preston.</p>

<p>The railway only touched the outskirts of
Chester, but the line was near the center of Preston,
which acquired importance from the fact that
the county court house was located there.</p>

<p>“Well, if we had some of the money that was
sunk around the piers of that bridge,” said Tom
reflectively, “our worries would be over,
Mother!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she agreed, as Tom waved his hand
toward the railroad structure, “but there’s no
use talking or thinking about that, Tom. It’s
past and gone, and the money has disappeared.”</p>

<p>“It disappeared all right enough,” and Tom’s
tone was the least bit menacing. “But I’m not
so sure that it disappeared fairly and honestly.
If it had sunk in a bed of quicksand it couldn’t
have vanished any more completely. But between
old Doolittle, the railroad lawyers and
some others—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, please don’t bring up that old dispute!”
begged his mother. “You know it can’t
do any good.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not,” he admitted. “But it
certainly is hard luck to look at what you think
ought to be yours, and know that some one else
is enjoying the benefit of it,” and Tom shook his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
finger at the big railroad bridge, as if that structure
of steel were, in some way, responsible for
the unpleasant circumstances of his mother and
himself.</p>

<p>The railroad bridge, or, rather, one of the
ends and the approach, was located on land that
had formed a part of Mr. Taylor’s estate. The
land had always been considered valuable, and
when the railroad went through the value of
that property, as well as of other land near it,
rose rapidly.</p>

<p>Then came Mr. Taylor’s death, and his widow,
instead of receiving what she hoped for—a large
sum from the sale of the bridge site to the railway
people—received nothing at all. Inquiry
developed the fact that certain creditors of Mr.
Taylor’s, including a Mr. Aaron Doolittle and
a Captain Cason Hawkesbury, held a claim on
the bridge land, and they received the money
for it from the railroad.</p>

<p>But, as Mrs. Taylor said, that was past and
gone, though Tom could not forget it. There
was always resentment in his heart, for he believed
his mother should have received something
for her rights. But they were not able
to hire competent lawyers, and the young member
of the bar who wound up the affairs of Mr.
Taylor’s estate did not seem to think there was
a chance of getting anything by litigation over
the bridge property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“We must go back, Tom,” said his mother
finally. “I’ve enjoyed the little walk, and I feel
better for it. But I must get that dress done,
and I’m sure you are hungry.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind admitting that I am,” he
said, with a final look at the bridge, over which,
at that moment, an express train was rumbling.</p>

<p>“Going right over our property as if it had a
right!” grumbled Tom.</p>

<p>“But they have a right, son,” his mother said
gently. “Don’t brood over that any more.”</p>

<p>Tom might have done so, in spite of her request,
but for something that happened shortly
after that. They were walking down the side
street toward their cottage, when a boy with a
bundle of papers under his arm, came along.</p>

<p>“Will you take yours now, Mrs. Taylor, or
shall I leave it at the house?” he asked, touching
his cap and smiling.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it,” said Tom. “I forgot the <i>Banner</i>
came out to-day. Wonder if they have a
good account of our baseball game.”</p>

<p>The <i>Banner</i> was the weekly paper issued in
Chester, and Mrs. Taylor subscribed to it.
Tom took the sheet from the delivery boy, and
rapidly scanned the front page.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “here’s a big account of the
game. And here—Say, Mother! Look here!”
he exclaimed, holding the paper up in front of
her, and pointing out a certain item. “There’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
going to be a competitive examination for a West
Point cadetship! It’s going to take place in
Preston in two weeks. It’s open to all the lads
around here. Congressman Hutton has an appointment
to make, and he’s going to let it go to
the fellow who gets the best standing.</p>

<p>“Say, this is great! Wonderful! Mother,
I’m going to have a try for that! A vacancy has
unexpectedly occurred, it says. It’s my chance,
Mother! It’s my chance!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br><span class="small">THE EXAMINATION</span></h2></div>


<p>Tom Taylor was really quite excited. He
strode along the street quickly, fluttering the paper
containing the wonderful news, until finally
Mrs. Taylor was obliged to call out:</p>

<p>“Tom, dear! You seem to forget that I
haven’t my seven-league boots on. I can’t keep up
with you,” and she laughed, though there was a
worried look in her eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s so, Mother! I beg your pardon,”
Tom said. “I forgot about everything except
this chance. Say! it’s great; isn’t it?” and he
looked at his mother with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you really going to attempt it?” she
asked softly.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, of course,” Tom said, quickly.
“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can pass, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not absolutely sure of it, of course.
No one is. But I think I can pass the preliminary
physical test, and that will admit me to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
written examination. I’ve been making some inquiries
about that, and there isn’t any subject
that we haven’t had in our high school work. I
may be a bit rusty on certain things, but I’m going
to bone up on them. I’ve got a week or
more.”</p>

<p>“And if you pass this examination that is to
be held at Preston, does that mean you’ll become
a cadet?” asked his mother.</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t, worse luck!” Tom exclaimed,
with a rueful laugh. “But if I come out ahead
in this preliminary examination, and get the appointment
from Congressman Hutton, it means
that I have a chance to go to West Point, and
have a try there. And there’s where it will be
pretty stiff, I imagine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, I—I hope you get it,” his mother
murmured.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho! Thought you didn’t want to see
me in the army?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want to see you go to war,”
his mother said gently. “But if it is your ambition
to become a West Pointer, and if, as you
say, there is a chance to do good work outside
of shooting and killing, why, I shall not oppose
you. Now let’s hurry home. I must get the
dress finished, West Point or not,” and she
smiled.</p>

<p>Tom walked beside her, reading over and over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
again the notice of the examination soon to be
held. In brief it was a statement from the congressman
of that district to the effect, that, as
he had a chance to name a youth to go to West
Point, he had decided to throw the chance open
to all the eligible lads of his district. They were
to report at the Preston Court House on a certain
day.</p>

<p>“And I’ll be there!” exclaimed Tom. “But
I say though—hold on. There’s something I
almost forgot!” and a shade of annoyance
passed over his face.</p>

<p>“What is it, Tom?” asked his mother, as they
neared the cottage.</p>

<p>“I have to have a hundred dollars, Mother.”</p>

<p>“A hundred dollars, Tom! What for?”</p>

<p>“To deposit at West Point,—that is if I get
the permanent appointment,” he explained.
“It’s a sort of guarantee to cover preliminary
cost of equipment, and so on. I almost forgot
that. A hundred dollars! It’s a pile of
money!”</p>

<p>“But you don’t need it right away; do you?”</p>

<p>“No, not until June, when I’ll have to report
at the Military Academy in case I’m successful.
But—”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry about that part of it—at
least not now,” said his mother. “When the
time comes I may find a way to get it. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
want to see you lose this chance. Don’t worry
about the money or it may spoil your chances
for passing the examination. I dare say I shall
manage somehow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you only can, Mother!” and, even
though they were out in the street, Tom put his
arms around her and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom!” she remonstrated.</p>

<p>“Don’t you care!” he cried, gaily. “Nobody
saw us, and I don’t mind in the least if they
did.”</p>

<p>Supper was rather an excited meal, and Tom
fairly ran home with the dress his mother finished.
He was paid, and as he carried back the
money he thought:</p>

<p>“It’s a shame I can’t make more myself. I
don’t like the idea of taking the money mother
earns with her needle to go to West Point with.
I sure do want to go, though!”</p>

<p>“But I’ll make good!” he declared to himself,
“and when I do, and when I’m earning a decent
salary, I’ll make it all up to mother. She can
live with me in barracks, perhaps, and I’ll be an
engineer in charge of some big work. Say, it
sure will be great!”</p>

<p>His mind filled with such rosy dreams of the
future as these, Tom hurried around a corner,
and ran full tilt into a man advancing from the
opposite direction. So hard was the impact that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Tom would have knocked down the man but that
he caught hold of him and held him up.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!” Tom exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Hey! Heck! Huh—! Huh—! Ahem!
Ah!” the man ejaculated, trying to recover the
breath that had been driven from his body.
“What do you mean by running into me like that,
young man? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon—Oh, it’s Mr. Doolittle!”
Tom exclaimed. “I didn’t see you
and—”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better look where you’re goin’
next time!” was the snappish response. “Oh,
it’s you, is it?” and he seemed for the first time
to recognize Tom. “Might have known,” he
muttered. “Nobody else would be rushin’
around corners like that but you!”</p>

<p>“I hope you’re not hurt, Mr. Doolittle!” Tom
ventured to say, as he picked up the hat of the
man who had succeeded to most of Mr. Taylor’s
property.</p>

<p>“Hurt? Huh! More by good luck than
your efforts if I’m not!” was grunted out. “Is
my hat dented?”</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t seem to be hurt a bit,” Tom
said, as cheerfully as he could. He brushed it
off, and Mr. Doolittle placed it on his head.</p>

<p>“Um! Humph!” was all the answer Tom received,
and then, muttering to himself, the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
who was counted one of the wealthiest in Chester
passed on in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Hope he doesn’t tack on an extra charge for
interest just because I ran into him,” thought
Tom, as he kept on. He said nothing to his
mother of the encounter as he handed her the
money he had brought home for the dress.</p>

<p>When Tom went to school next day he discovered
that a number of his classmates had seen the
notice about the competitive examination to be
held for the West Point cadetship, and several
announced their intention to try it. At the suggestion
of one of them they decided to learn the
line of questioning that would be followed, and
to study up on those subjects specially. The
school principal heard of their intentions and
kindly offered to coach them, which offer was
gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>Then began busy days for Tom Taylor. He
was well up in his studies, and he had little to fear
regarding the physical examination, but there was
always the haunting fear lest something should
happen. So he studied early and late until the
day set for the taking of the examination.</p>

<p>Tom arose early that morning, and with a last
final look at his books, and with a kiss from his
mother, he set off to take the trolley to Preston.
He met several of his chums on the same errand.</p>

<p>The examinations would take all of one day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
and part of the next, and some of those, who
came from a distance, had to stop at the Preston
Hotel. But Tom could go home at night.</p>

<p>On reaching the court house, where the examinations
were to be conducted, Tom found a number
of other lads there. Most of them were
strangers to him, coming from distant parts of
the congressional district.</p>

<p>Congressman Hutton was on hand, personally
to direct matters, and three physicians were in
attendance to conduct the physical examination.
To Tom’s delight he went through this successfully,
as he had expected. But some of the boys
were rejected, and with tears of regret in their
eyes they went back home.</p>

<p>Tom came from the room where he had been
thumped, pounded, made to read cards at varying
distances to test his eyesight, and had had his
heart listened to after jumping violently up and
down.</p>

<p>“You’ll do, young man,” the chief physician
had said gruffly. “Get your clothes on.”</p>

<p>Tom’s heart beat high with hope. As he was
going out to join the other candidates, some successful
thus far, and some not, Tom saw a young
man, flashily dressed, standing near a window,
smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Better cut that out if you’re going in for the
exam,” suggested a lad near the smoker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not worrying,” was the sneering retort.
“They can’t turn <i>me</i> down.”</p>

<p>The speaker turned, and Tom saw that he was
Clarence Hawkesbury, the nephew of Captain
Hawkesbury, who had come into possession of so
much of Mr. Taylor’s property. Clarence
looked at Tom and bowed coldly. They had
known each other for some time, but Tom did
not care for Clarence, and his “sporty” ways,
and certainly young Hawkesbury had no liking
for Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, if you got through I’m sure I can,”
Clarence said sneeringly to our hero as he passed.
“I’m going to get this appointment!” he added.</p>

<p>“If you do you’ll have to beat me!” thought
Tom, grimly.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br><span class="small">ANXIOUS DAYS</span></h2></div>


<p>Tom realized that this first preliminary mental
examination was, in a way, not so important as
would be the one he must undergo later at West
Point, should he be successful in receiving the
appointment. But still he knew he must do his
best, for there were a number of lads competing,
all as anxious as he was to receive the coveted
honor.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Tom was a little fearful
of Clarence. Though the nephew of Captain
Hawkesbury was, or wanted to be considered, a
“sport,” still he was a brilliant student when he
took a little pains. The trouble with him was
that he would do only the minimum amount of
study at the high school, and in consequence did
not stand high.</p>

<p>But it was evident that he had done some extra
preparation for this test, and, as Tom learned
afterward, Clarence had, on the suggestion of his
uncle, engaged a private tutor. In addition Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Hawkesbury, who was an old army officer,
knew in a general way what sort of questions
would be asked, and he (so Clarence boasted)
had been giving the nephew “points.”</p>

<p>Captain Hawkesbury was very fond of his
rather careless nephew in a certain way. The
lad was the son of an only brother of the captain’s,
and both of Clarence’s parents had died
when he was a small boy. Perhaps this accounted,
in a measure, for his slack ways, his
wastefulness with money, and his love for fast
companions.</p>

<p>“But it won’t do to think he can’t beat me,”
Tom reasoned. “I’ve just got to do my best to
stand far ahead of him.”</p>

<p>A room in the court house had been set aside
for the candidates, and several local high school
teachers were on hand, working in connection
with the congressman, to see that matters went
off properly.</p>

<p>The boys were seated at tables, well separated,
and the rules governing the examination explained
to them. Then with pencil and paper,
and with the list of questions before them, they
set to work.</p>

<p>A hasty glance on the part of Tom showed
him that the history examination, which was the
first, was comparatively easy. He had always
been fond of the study, and had a natural aptitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
for remembering names and the dates of
important events. There was only one question
of which he was not quite certain, but he realized
that the missing of one would not seriously pull
down his average.</p>

<p>He looked around at the other boys, some of
whom were writing away bravely, while others
were hopelessly, or helplessly, biting the ends
of their pencils, or else staring up at the ceiling
as if to draw inspiration from that.</p>

<p>Clarence Hawkesbury was seated in front of
Tom, and in the next aisle. As our hero was on
his last question, having temporarily passed the
one about which he was in doubt, Tom saw Clarence
working with his right hand partly up the
left sleeve of his coat. It was as if the captain’s
nephew was trying to pull down a wrinkled
part of his shirt that annoyed him.</p>

<p>Tom watched, rather idly, and saw Clarence
glance quickly around the room. What he saw,
or, rather, what he did not see, appeared to be
satisfactory, for the lad took from the sleeve of
his coat a small folded paper. He glanced at
it quickly and then let go of it.</p>

<p>To Tom’s surprise the paper quickly disappeared
up the sleeve again, with a snapping motion
that could leave but one inference.</p>

<p>“He’s got some answers written down on a
paper, and it’s fastened to a rubber band up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
sleeve,” decided Tom. “He can pull it down,
and, when he lets go of it, the paper snaps back
up his sleeve again. It’s a sharp trick all right.”</p>

<p>It was evident that Clarence had received from
his concealed paper the information he lacked,
for he at once began writing rapidly.</p>

<p>“The sneak!” mused Tom. “I can’t tell on
him, of course, but if he passes this exam, and
I don’t—!”</p>

<p>Tom shrugged his shoulders. There was
nothing he could do.</p>

<p>Tom turned in his paper, and, a little later,
Clarence did the same. The arrogant youth
wore a confident air, and winked his eye at Tom.</p>

<p>The arithmetic and algebra tests were more
difficult, but Tom was pretty sure he had passed,
especially in the former. There was one problem
in the binomial theorem that appalled him
for a time. But he set his mind to it, and worked
it out in a manner he felt sure was right.</p>

<p>Once again he saw Clarence surreptitiously refer
to a paper which he pulled down from his
sleeve. It was a risky proceeding, as the high
school instructors were walking about the room,
looking for any such cheating. But luck (if one
can call it luck) favored Clarence. The instructor
assigned to his section of the room was rather
elderly and near-sighted, and Clarence was not
caught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“Of course I’m not sure he’s using a pony,”
thought Tom, “but it certainly does look so.”</p>

<p>During the noon recess, when the boys were
allowed to get some lunch, there were all sorts
of excited talk about the examinations of the
morning. Some declared them “easy,” and
others expressed the opinion that they were
“stiff.” Some of the lads, hastily eating a sandwich,
began studying feverishly, in anticipation
of the afternoon ordeal. Tom decided that he
would be better off if he freshened his mind with
a walk, for he felt he had done all the studying
he could manage with profit, and he reasoned that
the hardest part of the ordeal was over.</p>

<p>Two studies formed the basis for examination
in the afternoon, and two were set down for the
following morning. Tom finished about four
o’clock, being one of the first to hand in his papers,
and he started to take the trolley back to
Chester.</p>

<p>“Think you passed, Tom?” asked a fellow
high school student, who came along a little later.</p>

<p>“Well, I sure hope so!” Tom answered.
“What did you think of it all?”</p>

<p>“Some wasn’t as bad as I was afraid it would
be, and part of it was worse. I’m worried about
my algebra.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think that was so hard, except that
one problem. But I managed to make mine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
prove, though maybe they won’t pass my
method.”</p>

<p>“You’re lucky, Tom!” returned his companion.</p>

<p>Tom was not so sure about that.</p>

<p>“Wait until I see if I get the appointment,”
he thought.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor was anxiously waiting for her son,
and inquired as to how the examination had gone.
Of course Tom could tell nothing definite, but
he and his mother indulged in high hopes. Mrs.
Taylor really wanted Tom to go to West Point,
since he had so set his heart on it. She felt that,
somehow, she would raise the necessary hundred
dollars for deposit, even if she had to sell some
of the small amount in securities that she kept
against the proverbial rainy day.</p>

<p>Tom was up early next morning, and again
made the trip to Preston. Some of the boys who
had been there the day before were not now on
hand. It was whispered that one of them had
been caught cheating in getting information from
a fellow competitor. Both had been barred.</p>

<p>“I wonder if one of them was Clarence?”
mused Tom, as he heard this talk going around
before the hour set for the final tests.</p>

<p>But when the doors were being closed Clarence
came in, tossing aside the butt of a cigarette.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Here comes the sport,” some one murmured.
Clarence heard it, and looked up, obviously
not ill-pleased.</p>

<p>This examination was more difficult than Tom
had anticipated, and he worked hard over the
list of questions. So did most of the other boys,
though a few “took it easy.” But perhaps they
recognized the fact that they had no chance, and
so did not worry. Clarence seemed to be writing
diligently.</p>

<p>“He’s evidently going into this for all he’s
worth,” thought Tom. “Well, so am I, for that
matter.”</p>

<p>It was something of a nervous strain, and Tom
was glad when it was over and he could hand in
his papers and go home.</p>

<p>Then came days of anxious waiting—days in
which Tom and his mother discussed the possibilities
of the case from all angles. Had Tom
passed with a high enough average, enough higher
than that of the other candidates, to secure the
appointment?</p>

<p>There could be but one lad named, with another
as alternate, who, in case the first one failed in
the tests to be conducted at West Point, would be
named for the coveted honor.</p>

<p>Tom dreaded to hear the sound of the postman’s
whistle. But for nearly a week there was
no word. Then when Tom felt, in his desperation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
as though he would simply have to telephone
to the congressman, and learn what had been the
outcome, there came, addressed to him, a long
legal-looking envelope. In the upper left-hand
corner was the imprint of the congressman’s
name. It had come from his private law office in
Preston.</p>

<p>Tom’s fingers trembled, and his heart beat with
a smothery, choking sensation. Had he passed?
Would he receive the appointment?</p>

<p>Slowly he tore open the envelope.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br><span class="small">SUCCESS</span></h2></div>


<p>There was a blur before Tom’s eyes; a blur
that made the letters and words on the paper in
front of him seem misty and far away. He
caught his breath sharply. He remembered that
his mother was watching him eagerly—anxiously.</p>

<p>“I won’t show the white feather before her, no
matter what happens,” he told himself, fiercely.
“If I’ve failed—”</p>

<p>He pulled himself together with an effort.
After all, he did not yet know that he had failed.
He brushed his hand across his eyes, and the blur
vanished. He caught sight of one word—“congratulations.”</p>

<p>That could mean but one thing. He must have
passed! Quickly he read enough of the letter
from the congressman to gather its import.</p>

<p>It was true. Tom had passed the preliminary
examination with the highest mark!</p>

<p>“Hurrah, Mother!” Tom cried. “It’s all
right! I’ve passed! I’ve won out, Mr. Hutton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
says! I got the highest marks of any in the
examination, and he’s sent my name as his nominee
for West Point to the Secretary of War.
Think of that! To the Secretary of War!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope there’ll be no war!” murmured
Mrs. Taylor.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that part of it, mother!”
Tom cried. “Just think of it! I’m going to be
a West Point cadet. That is, if I pass the rest
of the examinations,” he added more soberly.</p>

<p>“Are there more?” asked Mrs. Taylor.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” Tom replied. “I’ll have to
answer a lot more questions, and stiffer ones than
those they put to us at Preston. I’ll have to go
before the doctors, too. But I’m not worrying
about that. I’ll have some time before the
middle of June, when I have to take the final
entrance examinations, and I’ll bone up in the
meanwhile. Say, Mother, this is great!” cried
Tom, with shining eyes. “Simply great!”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you have succeeded so far, Tom,”
said his mother in a low voice. “But it will
mean a great deal to me to have you away. Still,
I suppose you can come home often. West Point
isn’t very far off.”</p>

<p>Tom was silent a moment. His face grew
sober.</p>

<p>“No, Mother,” he said, slowly, “I’m afraid
I’ll not be able to get back to see you very often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
if I go to West Point. Cadets are allowed only
one furlough in the four years. That is, unless
something extraordinary happens. I can come
home after I’ve been there two years, but not
before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom!”</p>

<p>“But you can come to see me,” he added,
quickly, for he felt a pang himself at the thought
of the long separation.</p>

<p>There were tears in Mrs. Taylor’s eyes as she
said, softly:</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, I almost wish you hadn’t passed!”</p>

<p>He looked at her blankly.</p>

<p>“That is, I don’t want to lose you,” she went
on. “But if you have your heart set on it, I
suppose it is all for the best. You can’t remain
my little boy forever.”</p>

<p>Tom felt a lump coming up into his throat,
but his mother, seeing which way matters were
going smiled as she said:</p>

<p>“There, Tom! we mustn’t be sad when
there’s so much cause for rejoicing. Of course
you must go away. All boys do, sooner or later.
And if you went to college you’d have to leave
me.”</p>

<p>“This is better than any college!” cried Tom,
enthusiastically. “West Point beats them all, in
my estimation. Why, just think of it, they pay
you for learning there! I’ll get real money—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
is after a while. I’ll send you some,” he
announced. “But say, Mother, now that I have
passed so far, and there is a chance of my going
to the Academy, what about that hundred dollars
deposit? Can we raise it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’ll manage somehow. Now let me
see your letter. Is that all Mr. Hutton says, that
you have passed?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t read it all myself, yet. That’s as
far as I got. Hello, what’s this?” he exclaimed
as his eyes took in the remainder of the epistle.
“Hawkesbury named as alternate! Well, I suppose
that’s only fair, but I’d rather it would have
been some one else.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Mrs. Taylor.</p>

<p>“Why you see, Mother,” Tom explained, “the
congressman names two candidates. The one
getting the highest average is first, and the one
who comes second is the alternate. That’s to
provide, in case the first named doesn’t pass the
further examinations at West Point, for some one
to take his place, and have a try. Otherwise
there’d have to be another preliminary test. So
Clarence Hawkesbury is my alternate; eh?”</p>

<p>“Does that annoy you, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. For we’ll not both be in West Point,
that is, unless he comes up again next year in case
of a vacancy. It will have to be either him or
me this time, and I rather think,” said Tom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
slowly, “it will be I. I’m going to pass, and make
good!”</p>

<p>There was an air of determination about him
as he said this that was good to see.</p>

<p>Tom read the letter over again. It gave few
details except those that have been mentioned,
but it contained the information that, in due time,
formal notification would come from the Secretary
of War, directing Tom when and where to
apply at West Point for the further examinations,
physical and mental.</p>

<p>Doubtless Clarence Hawkesbury had received
a similar letter, and would also be told to apply
at West Point when the time came for the final
entrance examination.</p>

<p>“I only hope he doesn’t travel with me,”
thought Tom, for though he had no ill-feeling
against Clarence, yet the rich nephew of the old
army officer had frequently made it unpleasant
for Tom when they had met.</p>

<p>Formerly Mr. Taylor and Captain Hawkesbury
had been rather intimate but, with the death
of Tom’s father, and the discovery that most of
his fortune had, in some manner, been acquired
by the army officer and Mr. Doolittle, Tom could
not help feeling coldly toward both the men.
There was no specific reason for it, but Mrs.
Taylor, too, did not like Captain Hawkesbury.
Nor had she any warmer regard for Mr. Doolittle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
though they both offered to do what they
could to help settle up the estate.</p>

<p>The trouble of it was that there was very little
left to be settled up—that is little for Tom and
his mother, and Mrs. Taylor preferred the services
of a young lawyer to those of Captain
Hawkesbury or Mr. Doolittle.</p>

<p>In view of this it can easily be imagined that
Tom did not have the warmest feeling in the
world for the arrogant and supercilious youth
who was to be his rival—a rival, at least, until
the results of the final entrance examinations were
known.</p>

<p>Once the delicious thrill of excitement following
the receipt of the congressman’s letter was
over, Tom and his mother began to consider ways
and means. It would mean a change for them if
Tom was to live permanently at West Point for
four years. There was much to be done to get
ready. But Tom, in the flush of his first success,
made little of these preparations.</p>

<p>“We’ll manage—somehow,” said Mrs. Taylor,
cheerfully.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br><span class="small">AN ATTACK</span></h2></div>


<p>A few days after Tom had received the letter
from Congressman Hutton, our hero was further
elated to get another missive through the
mail. This came in a long official-looking envelope.
It bore the imprint of the Secretary of
War’s office, and came through the post office
without bearing a stamp, which fact further gave
Tom an idea of the importance he was beginning
to assume.</p>

<p>“Though of course Clarence got one like it,
too, I suppose,” he thought. “Well, I can’t
have everything to myself.”</p>

<p>The letter from the Secretary of War, signed
with his own name, much to Tom’s delight, formally
notified our hero of his appointment, and
directed him to report on a certain date, about
the middle of June, at West Point for further examination.</p>

<p>“And now,” decided Tom, after he had shown
the secretary’s letter to his mother and to many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
admiring friends, “I’m going to buckle down to
hard work. I’ve just got to pass those exams!”</p>

<p>Tom had little doubt as to the result of the
physical tests. He was in fine condition; he had
lived a manly, clean life.</p>

<p>He played baseball and football in season, he
was a good runner, jumper and swimmer. In
short, he was an average, healthful American lad—a
good all-around athlete, though no phenomenon
in any one branch of sport.</p>

<p>He had been quickly passed by the first doctors
who examined him, and though he realized that
the physical tests at West Point would be more
severe, he was not worrying on that score.</p>

<p>“But they may spring something on me in the
mental tests that I’m not ready for,” mused Tom.
“So I’m going to buck up.”</p>

<p>With this end in view he went to his high
school principal, and had him map out a course
of extra study that would bridge our hero over
several rather shaky places. This was about the
middle of May, so Tom had nearly a full month
in which to prepare.</p>

<p>He heard indirectly that Clarence Hawkesbury
was doing the same thing, but Clarence
made rather a secret of it. Tom met him one
evening in town, after a moving picture show
given under the auspices of a high school society.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the good word?” asked Clarence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
with an appearance of good-fellowship Tom
knew did not exist. Clarence blew out a cloud of
highly-scented cigarette smoke as he put the question.</p>

<p>“Oh, everything’s lovely,” Tom answered,
easily.</p>

<p>“Hear you’re going to West Point with me, as
alternate,” went on Clarence, speaking in unnecessarily
loud tones.</p>

<p>“I thought it was the other way around,” responded
Tom, slowly. “I understand you are
the alternate.”</p>

<p>“Pooh, you didn’t beat me more than five
points on the average,” boasted Clarence, and
this was true enough as far as the mental examination
went. It was not true with the physical,
however. “And I’ll lay you odds of two to one
that I stay at West Point and you come back,”
went on Clarence, sneeringly.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I don’t bet,” replied Tom.
“But that needn’t stop you,” he added, for he
did not want to be thought a prig.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry! it won’t!” declared the
youth, who had more money than was good for
him. He swung off down the street with some
cronies, spenders like himself, and a little later
Tom and a chum or two passed them standing in
the door of a poolroom, whence came the click
of the ivory and colored balls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>As Tom passed he saw Clarence and Isaac
Blake, two cronies, in close conversation in one
corner of the doorway. Apparently they did not
observe Tom, who heard Isaac remark:</p>

<p>“Think you’ll get a chance at him?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make the chance, if I don’t get it,” muttered
Clarence. “If I can’t get there one way I
shall another. Can I depend on you?”</p>

<p>“You sure can,” Ike said, and then Tom heard
no more, for he passed on down the street.</p>

<p>“I wonder who it is they want a chance at?”
Tom reflected. But if he gave it any further
thought it was to guess idly that the talk referred
to some one whom Clarence wanted to beat at
pool or billiards.</p>

<p>That night Tom sat up late doing some extra
studying, for he had neglected his lessons somewhat
in order to go to the picture show.</p>

<p>Tom felt a bit tired the next day. He realized
what caused it—studying too late. His eyes, too,
were tired; possibly from pouring too long over
text books, added to the strain of watching what
the Scotchman called the “shiftin’ pictures.”</p>

<p>“I know what I’m going to do,” thought Tom.
“I’ll go for a walk down by the river. It’s a
fine day, and it ought to be nice on the water.
I’ll get a boat and go for a row all by myself. I
want to calm down. I’ve been doing too much
thinking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>It was Friday, and because of some special exercises
the high school closed earlier than usual.
Tom hurried home, changed into an old suit that
would not be soiled by the water or mud in a
boat, and made his way to the river. There were
several pavilions where boats could be hired, but
Tom, feeling rather in the mood for walking, went
on until he had nearly reached the big railroad
bridge, not far from which was a boathouse.</p>

<p>“And to think my father once owned all this
land,” Tom mused as he looked at the big foundations
on one side of the river. “If we had what
the railroad company paid for it mother wouldn’t
have to work so hard. Of course money wouldn’t
make any difference to me at West Point. That’s
one place where money doesn’t count. But if we
had a few thousands mother could be nearer me,
say in New York, and she could run up to see me
once in a while. It’s going to be a long drill—two
years at a stretch. But I guess I can stand it
all right.”</p>

<p>Tom was about to proceed to the boathouse to
hire a craft, when he was aware of a figure coming
around a bend in the path that led to the river.
A moment later he saw that it was Captain
Hawkesbury. Rather a stern and forbidding
figure it was too, for the uncle of Clarence was a
gruff man, though it was said he was very fond of
his nephew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Good afternoon, sir,” said Tom, saluting in
what he hoped was the correct military fashion.</p>

<p>“Um! Afternoon,” was the half-grunted retort.
Nor did Captain Hawkesbury take the
trouble to return the salute. Perhaps he did not
see it, or Tom may not have executed it properly.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you! is it; young Taylor?” went on
the captain, looking at our hero from under
shaggy, heavy eyebrows. “Um! I—er—I understand
you’re going to have a try at West Point,
young man.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Captain! I’m going to take the examinations.”</p>

<p>“And my nephew—er—he’s going too?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s my alternate!”</p>

<p>Tom could not refrain from that little exultation.</p>

<p>“Um, yes. Well, I don’t wish you any bad
luck, young man, but I believe Clarence will win.
He comes of fighting stock, sir! fighting stock!”
and the army captain smote the ground with his
cane, making the dirt fly.</p>

<p>“We have some fighters in our family, too,”
Tom said, not to be outdone. “On my father’s
and mother’s side we boast of what our families
did in the Revolution.”</p>

<p>“Um! Oh yes, the Taylors did their share—their
share,” admitted Captain Hawkesbury.
“Well, we shall see! We shall see!” and muttering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
something under his breath, which Tom
was not able to catch, the old fighter strode
along.</p>

<p>“Not a very cheerful sort of man,” thought
Tom, as he went down to get a boat. He thoroughly
enjoyed the row on the river, and began to
feel more like himself. He rowed until the
lengthening shadows warned him it was time to
return to his home, and a little later he was walking
along the river bank.</p>

<p>Around a bend, near the place where he had
met Captain Hawkesbury some time before, Tom
heard voices, two of which at least, were familiar
to him. The possessors of the voices were talking
and laughing rather hilariously.</p>

<p>Suddenly footsteps could be heard, indicating
that several persons were running along the hard-packed
path, and a moment later Tom saw Clarence,
Ike and a number of their cronies coming on
the run.</p>

<p>“Looks as though they were having a race,”
mused Tom.</p>

<p>“Get out the way! Let us pass! Don’t block
the path!” called Clarence. “One side, Taylor,
we’re trying to see who’s the best-footed.”</p>

<p>The path was narrow at this point. On one
side was the river and on the other a low, swampy
place. Tom had hardly room to get to one side.</p>

<p>“They have nerve,” he mused. “Why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
couldn’t they wait until they had room to race. I
can’t get out of their way.”</p>

<p>The other lads gave him no chance. On they
came swinging toward him, and, an instant later, as
Clarence tried to pass Tom, the rich youth slid
down the bank toward the river.</p>

<p>“Look out!” Tom cried.</p>

<p>“Look out yourself!” retorted Clarence
quickly. “What do you mean by shoving me?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” Tom answered.</p>

<p>“And I say you did!” snapped Clarence.
“You did it on purpose, and I’ll make you wish
you hadn’t!” He recovered himself and came
rushing at Tom with clenched fists.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br><span class="small">OFF TO WEST POINT</span></h2></div>


<p>Tom was taken almost completely by surprise
when the attack came. It seemed so uncalled for,
and so unnecessary. But Tom was not the one
to stand and be struck without giving, in a
measure, as good as he took, particularly when he
was not in the wrong.</p>

<p>“I—I’ll show you!” muttered Clarence. He
aimed a blow at Tom, but the latter cleverly
dodged and Clarence nearly over-balanced himself,
almost doing what he had wrongfully accused
Tom of trying to do, and falling into the
river.</p>

<p>“Soak him, Hawkesbury!” cried the cronies of
the rich lad. “Give it to him good and proper!”</p>

<p>“I will! Watch me!” cried Clarence, and
this time his blow landed in Tom’s face. The
pain was stinging, for Clarence was no light hitter,
but Tom came back instantly with as good a return.</p>

<p>In another moment the two boys were fighting,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
or rather, Clarence was attacking Tom, who defended
himself vigorously. He was at a loss to
account for the real savagery in the onslaught of
the other. It was as though some great enmity
were at the bottom of it, instead of being merely
a fancied wrong on the part of Clarence.</p>

<p>The latter missed another heavy blow at Tom,
who, in turn, countered, and swung so cleverly that
Clarence was sent swinging backward against one
of his companions.</p>

<p>“Here! Look out what you’re doing there,
Taylor!” growled the youth in question.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s getting too fresh!” chimed in Ike
Blake. “I guess I’ll have something to say in
this racket!”</p>

<p>As Clarence recovered himself, Ike doubled up
his fists and the two of them came at Tom together.
Our hero caught his breath. He was
not afraid, but it was manifestly unfair. The injustice
of it, however, did not seem to strike the
cronies of Clarence.</p>

<p>The latter reached Tom first, who, being unwilling
to take too many chances, led out with a
blow that might have been effective had it landed.
But Clarence dodged, and, a moment later a gruff
voice called out:</p>

<p>“Here! What’s the meaning of this! How
dare you attack my nephew? Stop it at once!”</p>

<p>The boys all turned to see the angry face of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Captain Hawkesbury fairly glaring at them. But
most of the anger seemed turned in Tom’s direction.</p>

<p>“Cease that attack at once!” came the order.
“You, young Taylor, I mean!”</p>

<p>Tom was not going to be unjustly accused without
a protest.</p>

<p>“Your nephew struck me first!” he retorted.
“I was just defending myself, and it looks as
though they all wanted to fight,” he added, with a
nod toward the cronies of the rich and arrogant
youth. “I don’t mind taking one at a time,”
Tom said more calmly, “but if they want to pile
on all at once I’m going to quit.”</p>

<p>“This fighting must cease!” declared the captain.
“Let my nephew alone, Taylor!”</p>

<p>“I’m perfectly willing to, if he’ll let me alone.
He struck me first.”</p>

<p>“He deliberately got in our way when we were
having a race, and nearly pushed me into the
water,” Clarence said.</p>

<p>“That isn’t true,” Tom said, calmly. “And
you know it, Hawkesbury!”</p>

<p>Clarence scowled but did not answer.</p>

<p>“Stop this at once!” went on the choleric man.
“I forbid this fight to go on. Clarence, you report
to me, and I’ll take this matter up with Taylor
later.”</p>

<p>Tom did not pay much attention to this. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
passed on, rather excited it is true, but feeling that
he had not had altogether the worst of it.</p>

<p>“Though I would have had if they’d all piled
on me at once, which they seemed about to do,”
Tom mused, as he walked on by himself. “I
wonder what their game was? Could it be that
Clarence wanted to ‘do’ me; to make me lame, or
bruise me so I’ll not show up well at the physical
examination in West Point?”</p>

<p>Like a flash there came to Tom the memory of
certain words he had overheard in the billiard hall
entrance.</p>

<p>“Clarence Hawkesbury could easily put up a
game like that, with the help of Ike Blake,” he
declared. “I wouldn’t be surprised but that was
it.</p>

<p>“If I fell down in the physical test, through being
slightly injured, or something like that, Clarence
would stand next for West Point. If that
was his game I’ve got to be on the lookout.”</p>

<p>Tom said nothing to his mother about the attack,
accounting for some scratches and bruises
by saying he had had a little mishap while boating.
And as Mrs. Taylor was so busy getting
Tom’s things ready for his trip to the military
academy she did not ask many questions.</p>

<p>“Oh, but that’s an unsightly bruise on your
face,” she said. “I hope it will disappear before
you go to West Point.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>“I think it will,” Tom said. “And I’ll take
good care not to get any more there,” he mused.</p>

<p>Tom saw nothing of Clarence during the next
few days, in which he was busy getting ready for
his trip up the Hudson. He also spent as much
time as he could working on his studies. But in
spite of all his hard work, he felt a horrible fear
at times that he would fail to reach the standard
set in the mental tests.</p>

<p>Finally he reached the point where he was in
such a nervous state that one of the high school
teachers who was coaching him advised him to
drop his books for a day or two, and live in the
open. This Tom did and his strained nerves came
back to normal again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor had raised the hundred dollars
that Tom must deposit to be allowed to take the
examination. If he failed it would be returned to
him, less a small charge for board during his stay
at West Point. Just how much his mother had
sacrificed to raise this sum Tom never knew.</p>

<p>“But I do wish you had more money to live on,
Mother,” he said a few days before he was to depart
for West Point. “You ought to be rich.”</p>

<p>“Riches do not always bring happiness, Tom,”
she said.</p>

<p>“They often help a whole lot,” Tom said, with
a smile. “But never mind, Mother, some day
when I’m an army officer, or a big engineer, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
shall be able to send you money regularly. Then
you won’t have to sew when you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like sewing,” said the widow. “I
wouldn’t sit around and do nothing. I couldn’t!”</p>

<p>The days passed more quickly now, at least to
Mrs. Taylor, though Tom thought each one was
forty-eight hours long. He planned to go to New
York by train from Chester, and as he would arrive
in the metropolis in the evening, he would
stay at a hotel there, and go on to Highland
Falls the next morning. Highland Falls is a village
a mile below West Point, and there most of
the prospective candidates stay before reporting
for their examinations. There are plenty of hotel
accommodations there.</p>

<p>Finally the day came. Tom said good-bye to
his mother, not without a choking sensation in his
throat, and he had to turn his head away and
blow his nose rather more often than seemed absolutely
necessary. She did not go to the station
with him, as she feared she would break down,
and she did not want to give way for Tom’s sake.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she faltered. “I—I know you’ll
do well, Tom.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be for want of trying,” he answered.
And a little later he found himself at the station,
watching the train pull in that was to take him on
the first stage of his trip to historic West Point.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br><span class="small">GETTING READY</span></h2></div>


<p>Our hero was excited, and no wonder. He had
gone through many unusual experiences since he
had begun to think of going to West Point, and
now he was on the verge of new ones. He was in
a sort of daze. Matters followed each other so
closely that there was little time between to think
properly of them.</p>

<p>“But there’s one thing sure,” he thought to himself,
as he sat looking from the car window as he
was being whirled along his way, “there is one
thing sure, and that is that I have the chance I’ve
been wanting so long. If I don’t make the most
of it, it will be my own fault.”</p>

<p>He ventured to look about him more calmly
now, thinking perhaps he might see some one in
the car whom he knew. But a quick glance
through the coach did not disclose any one, though
he noticed two or three lads about his own age,
talking and laughing together.</p>

<p>Tom thought he would like to know them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
he wondered if, by any chance, they could be in
his position—a “plebe” going up to West Point
for the all-important examination. Then another
thought came to our hero.</p>

<p>Where was Clarence Hawkesbury? He, too,
was supposed to go to take the examination on the
day Tom reported, which would be the morrow.
Where was Clarence?</p>

<p>“He may have gone on ahead, or he may motor
to New York,” Tom thought, for Captain
Hawkesbury had a powerful car, and with his
nephew frequently took long trips.</p>

<p>“I’m just as glad he isn’t going with me,” Tom
thought. Then he settled down to enjoy the journey
which would last all day. At noon Tom went
to the dining car for lunch, and there he saw, at
the table across the aisle from him, some of the
lads he had noticed in his own coach. He could
overhear some of their talk.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s one thing sure,” remarked a
sturdy-looking youth, “if I don’t get through it
isn’t going to kill me, and I won’t have to go
around four years with my back as straight as a
ramrod.”</p>

<p>Tom guessed instantly where his fellow-travelers
were going, but he did not like to say anything
just yet.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind the examinations so much,” a
studious-looking lad remarked, “but I sure do hate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
to think of getting hazed. They say it’s fierce!”</p>

<p>“So I’ve heard,” agreed another. “Pass the
celery; will you?”</p>

<p>“If they try to haze me!” exclaimed a heavy-browed
youth, “I’ll show ’em they’ll have their
hands full.”</p>

<p>“Well, the more trouble you make the more
they’ll make,” said the first speaker with a sigh.
“We plebes aren’t supposed to have any rights.”</p>

<p>Tom was sure, now, that the lads across the
aisle were “in the same boat” with himself. He
could not refrain from speaking to them.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he remarked, “but are
you going to take the West Point examinations?”</p>

<p>The others looked at him, rather curiously for
a moment, and one of them said:</p>

<p>“Yes, we are.”</p>

<p>“I’m in the same fix,” went on Tom, quickly.
“Do any of you know anything about what we
ought to do when we get there; where to report
and so on?”</p>

<p>In an instant the reserve of the others seemed
to melt, and they welcomed him, figuratively, with
open arms. They were companions in a certain
prospective misfortune. It developed that one
of the lads had a relative who had attended West
Point, and this relative had given some valuable
advice which the lad, Samuel Leland by name, was
glad to share with Tom and the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>From then on the talk was of nothing but West
Point, and the fear of hazing formed a large proportion
of the conversation. Tom found that his
new friends were going to stop at a different hotel
in New York from that which he had picked out,
and he decided to change and go with them. He
was glad he did, for when he arrived in the big
city he was fairly astonished by the bustle and
roar. One of the other boys had been there on
several occasions, however, and he acted as guide
to the others.</p>

<p>That night and the next day were a sort of
dream to Tom Taylor, for they decided to postpone
their trip to Highland Falls for a day and
see the sights of New York. Tom knew his
mother would not object, and if he succeeded in
passing into West Point it would be two years before
he could get away again. He sent his mother
a letter from the metropolis.</p>

<p>“Well, we might as well start and get it over
with,” remarked Sam Leland the next day to Tom
and the other candidates. They were at the hotel
in New York, and had planned to cross the Hudson
to Weehawken, to take the West Shore railroad,
which would bring them to the village a
mile below West Point. There they would stay
until next day when they were due to report for
examinations.</p>

<p>“Yes, no use lingering longer here,” agreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Tom. “I can’t enjoy anything when I think of
what’s before me.”</p>

<p>The others confessed the same thing, and, accordingly,
soon after lunch they took the ferry
to Weehawken, and in due time were on their
way to Highland Falls, a ride of about two hours.</p>

<p>Tom and the other lads walked up the winding
road leading from the Highland Falls station to
the hotel where they were to stop. The day was
warm and the road dusty and they were not feeling
any too comfortable. The little party Tom
had fallen in with saw several other youths toiling
up the hill, evidently with the same objective point
as themselves. They, too, were “candidates.”</p>

<p>A bath, a change of linen, and supper made
Tom feel much better, and then came a long evening
spent on the hotel porch where were many
other lads, all eager for what lay before them—eager
and anxious, most of them; some so much
so that they went about with books in their hands,
gluing their eyes to the pages every now and
then. They were “cramming for exams,” and no
greater torture can be devised for a young fellow.</p>

<p>Some of the boys told of having gone up to have
a look at West Point that day, they having been
at Highland Falls for some time, preparing for
the ordeal. Some were even being tutored at a
special preparatory school in the neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“The farther you fellows keep away from
West Point until it’s time for you to report, the
better,” said one lad who seemed to know whereof
he spoke. “Don’t give those cadets a chance
to get one in on you, which they’re sure to do if
they see you nosing around up at the barracks
before it’s time. Stay away until it’s time to report.”</p>

<p>This Tom and some of his friends resolved to
do. However, they could not refrain the next
morning from going a short distance toward the
group of gray stone buildings that make up the
United States Military Academy. In the distance
they could see the cadets passing to and fro, some
of them drilling; and Tom, at least, felt a thrill of
anticipation.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I can only get in!” he sighed.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” remarked Leland. “It sure
is a great place.”</p>

<p>The next day Tom, and the other candidates,
left the Highland Falls hotel to report to the superintendent
of the Academy, which was the real
beginning of the examination that meant so much
to them. At last they were to have a taste of life
at West Point, though for some of them it might
last only the few days intervening between their
official entrance and the rigid tests.</p>

<p>On the way to West Point Tom caught a
glimpse of Clarence Hawkesbury in company with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
some flashily dressed youths. They were riding in
a sort of public coach, and Clarence waved his
hand to Tom, as though the best of feeling existed
between them.</p>

<p>“I wonder where the superintendent’s office
is?” remarked one of the youths with Tom. “I
don’t suppose we dare speak to any of those high
and mighty cadets to ask.”</p>

<p>“Not if we see any one else,” Tom said. And
on their way they met a soldier—not a cadet—who
directed them to the headquarters building,
in which was located the office of the adjutant to
whom they were to report in person.</p>

<p>A number of rather anxious-looking lads were
there, and Tom and the others formed in line to
march up stairs. One by one they entered a room,
and presented their credentials to the stiff and
severe-looking officer who sat behind a table. He
glanced at their letters of appointment, checked
their names off on a list, and told them to go down
stairs and wait for further instructions.</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder what comes next?” said Tom
to his new friends. He soon learned. A cadet,
who, from the stripes on his arm they knew to
be a corporal, came walking stiffly up.</p>

<p>“Here, you candidates!” he cried, in a voice
that contained perhaps a little too much authority.
“Turn out! Lively now! Turn out! Form in a
column—by twos! Forward—march!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>There was an uneasy scramble, and a more or
less uneven column was formed to march along
with the corporal at the head. He was a martinet,
was that corporal—and he found fault with
every one and everything from the beginning.</p>

<p>“Why, you fellows don’t even know enough to
keep step!” he bawled at them. “Do you know
which your left foot is?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tom, who felt a little nettled
at the tone.</p>

<p>“Yes—what?” sharply demanded the corporal,
swinging around to face him.</p>

<p>“I thought you said—” stammered Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes—what?” fairly thundered the cadet.</p>

<p>“Say sir,” some one behind Tom whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes—sir!” he answered loudly.</p>

<p>“That’s better!” was the mollified retort.
“Don’t forget that sir! I’m glad some of you
know which is your left foot. Now then, step
out!”</p>

<p>They managed it a little better now, though
doubtless they were awkward enough.</p>

<p>“Eyes—front!” snapped out the corporal, as
some one ventured to look about. “Eyes—front!”</p>

<p>In due time the awkward squad was marched to
one of the barrack divisions, where the cadet officers,
in charge of the candidates, had their headquarters.
There the corporal reported Tom and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
the others to a cadet lieutenant who recorded them
and assigned them to quarters—three to a room.</p>

<p>Tom had thought that he and the others would
be examined before getting this far at West Point,
but it seemed he did not know all the routine yet.
At least, he was to have a real taste of life before
knowing whether or not he would be allowed to
remain.</p>

<p>The ordeal of being recorded by the lieutenant
was much more trying than in the case of the adjutant.
Some of the boys forgot the all-important
“sir,” and were sharply rebuked. But in the end
they learned how to answer properly, and to give
when they were asked where they were from, the
name of their state, and not the name of their
town or city.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget your ‘misters’ and ‘sirs,’” advised
the lieutenant as a parting shot, when Tom
and the other luckless candidates marched off to
the Cadet Store to draw their first supplies—their
housekeeping utensils as it were—for they were
to do their own work for a time. Each candidate
received from the Cadet Store a quantity of bedding,
a pillow, a mattress, a broom, a pail and a
chair, in addition to a dipper. These were to be
used while they were candidates, and could be kept
if they passed the examinations. If they failed
they would have to turn them in again, and from
the hundred dollars deposited would be deducted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the board for the time they had been at West
Point.</p>

<p>Tom’s mother had sent this sum on in advance,
a fact of which our hero was aware, though he did
not know the source whence the money came.</p>

<p>“Whew! This is some early rising!” exclaimed
Sam Leland as he examined the printed
list of “calls” that had been given to them after
they had secured their equipment.</p>

<p>Reveille came at six o’clock, followed half an
hour later by breakfast. At one o’clock dinner
was served, and supper came after retreat parade.
Of course the candidates had no part in the
parade.</p>

<p>“Oh, six o’clock isn’t so bad—not in summer,”
Tom said. He had often risen earlier than that
in winter to do a job of snow-shoveling to earn
money at home.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s early for me,” remarked Clarence
Hawkesbury, with a supercilious grin. “And
this dipper is—beastly!” he exclaimed, as he
looked at the one made from half a cocoanut
shell that had been issued to him. “I’m going to
buy a collapsible cup,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Better not,” advised some one who knew.
“Everything we’re allowed to have is strictly arranged
for, and if you’re caught with anything
contraband—good-night!”</p>

<p>“They won’t catch me!” Clarence said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Tom hoped Clarence wouldn’t have a chance
to be caught, since if Clarence remained it meant
that our hero would have failed. And that he
fiercely made up his mind not to do.</p>

<p>The candidates, with their new belongings, now
passed on to their rooms. Tom was quartered
with Sam Leland and a lad named Harry Houston.
He liked them both from the first.</p>

<p>“And now to get ready for the exams,” commented
Tom, when they found themselves in their
room.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br><span class="small">A SLIDE FOR LIFE</span></h2></div>


<p>Tom, who had, with the other two candidates,
dragged the bedding and other things to the room
they were to share in common, at least for a time,
looked at his companions. They hardly knew
what to do next, for they had received so many
orders and instructions that their minds were in
a whirl.</p>

<p>About them, through the corridors of the building,
they could hear other candidates going to
their rooms with their possessions. There was
not much noise, for the “lowly candidates” were
beginning to feel how unimportant they were compared
to the “lordly cadets.”</p>

<p>“Here comes some one,” remarked Sam, as
they saw their door pushed open. A corporal—a
supercilious and sneering corporal—entered.
Watson his name was, as they learned later.</p>

<p>“Here, you!” he said, sharply. “That’s no
way to pile your stuff. You—what’s your name?”
he asked, turning to Harry Houston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Er—Houston,” stammered the lad, and in a
flash Tom and Sam knew their friend had forgotten
the proper form.</p>

<p>“Mister Houston, sir!” fairly thundered the
corporal. “Say it after me!”</p>

<p>“Mister Houston, sir!” imitated the luckless
one.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” came in semi-mollified tones.
“Now I’ll show you how to get your room into
shape—and keep it so!” he added impressively.
“You’ll be inspected when you least look for it.
Don’t get caught, whatever you do!”</p>

<p>His manner was so important that Tom, at
least, resolved that there should not be a pin out
of place. The corporal showed them how to make
up their cots. He indicated the official Blue Book,
a copy of which was required to be kept at all
times in a certain place in the room. This book
gave minute directions for keeping the room in
order, and specified much as to the candidate’s
conduct.</p>

<p>Though neither Tom nor his companions were
cadets yet, the strictest military discipline must be
observed by them. They had to report on leaving
their room, and on coming back, and they
could not leave unless it was absolutely necessary.
It was a hard life, but doubtless it had the intended
effect.</p>

<p>Once the beds were arranged to the liking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the corporal, and he was not easy to please, Tom
and the others were taught to stand at “attention.”
This position—as stiff as a ramrod, with
eyes straight to the front, and never, by any
chance, allowed to rest on the countenance of the
officer—must be maintained whenever any cadet
officer, or the tactical officer in charge of instructions,
came into the quarters of the candidate.
The tactical officers were called “tacs,” and were
army officers, graduates from the Academy, who,
in turn, were stationed for four years at West
Point to give military instruction.</p>

<p>“And we’ve got to look out for the tacs,” said
Sam Leland, when the corporal had left them
alone for a time. “They’re always showing up
when you least expect them, and if they find a
thing out of place in your room—fare thee well,
gentle maiden!” and he sighed, and dropped
wearily into a chair.</p>

<p>“Well, if I don’t get something to eat pretty
soon, they won’t have any trouble with me, nor I
with them,” observed Harry.</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Tom, curiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll drop dead from hunger—that’s why. I
wonder if they’ll give me a funeral with full military
honors in case I die on their hands?” he
asked, whimsically.</p>

<p>“No such luck!” returned Tom, with a laugh.
“But I think it must be time for dinner. It’s one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
o’clock and there goes a crowd of the cadets toward
the dining hall.”</p>

<p>They looked from the window to observe the
nattily dressed lads march along to stirring music.
Presently came the summons the candidates were
waiting for. In columns of twos they marched
to the mess hall, entering last, and were given
seats at a table some distance removed from that
at which the yearlings, or cadets who had been
at the Academy a year, were to eat.</p>

<p>The dinner was excellent, but there was no lingering
over it. When the candidates had been
marched back to their barracks Tom and his
chums decided to put in some time at studying.
Twice while they were at work a corporal came
in to inspect their room, and each time they had
to rise smartly, and stand at attention until he
went out. No fault could be found with the lads
themselves or their room, and at this the corporal
seemed to be deeply disappointed.</p>

<p>Studying went on until parade time, which
brought with it a rigid inspection of each candidate
in person, from his collar to his shoes. Some
were reprimanded for not being neat enough.</p>

<p>“Parade rest!” came the order after inspection,
after which there boomed out on the evening
air the sound of the retreat gun. Then followed
a march to the mess hall for supper.</p>

<p>“And now for some more boning,” Tom observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
with a sigh, when he and his three chums
were in their room again.</p>

<p>“Say, we’re not getting an awful lot of fun out
of this,” said Sam, as he opened his arithmetic.</p>

<p>“We didn’t exactly come here for fun,” Harry
remarked.</p>

<p>Tom looked critically over the room, and
straightened a pillow on his bed, for he knew that
inspection was timed for nine-thirty, and he wanted
no reproof.</p>

<p>The “tac” came in, looked over everything
with a coldly calm and critical eye, while Tom
and his chums stood stiffly at attention.</p>

<p>“Make up your beds,” he said to them, as he
went out, and they breathed easier.</p>

<p>They would be allowed to have a light until
ten o’clock. At that hour taps was sounded—three
beats of a drum—at which signal every
candidate must be in bed, with lights out. A dark-lantern
inspection would follow some time later,
and it would not be well for any of the new lads
to be caught with a gleam of light in his room, nor
must he be anywhere but between the covers, and
with his room in perfect order. It certainly was
a life of military hardship and exactness from the
very start. And, as yet, none of the lads knew
whether he was to be a cadet eventually or not.</p>

<p>You may be sure Tom and his two new chums
did not oversleep the next morning. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
dressed and waiting for the sound of the reveille
gun which presently boomed out, followed by the
thunder of drums and the shrill squealing of fifes
in the hall below.</p>

<p>“Candidates turn out!” came the command,
and the new lads came pouring from their rooms,
helter-skelter, anxious not to be late.</p>

<p>“And now for the ordeal,” groaned Tom, as,
after breakfast, he and the others, in squads of
ten, were marched toward the cadet hospital,
where they were to undergo a searching physical
examination.</p>

<p>Three army surgeons, grim and grizzled, went
over each boy minutely. Their feet were looked
at, for the United States government, as well as
that of other nations, has found that a soldier to
be of value must not be troubled with corns and
ingrowing nails. It impedes his marching. And
as a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, so
a company can march no faster than its poorest
walker. No poor walkers are wanted.</p>

<p>And teeth—</p>

<p>“You’d think we were horses up for sale,”
complained Clarence Hawkesbury, after one of
the doctors had made him and the others open
their mouths. Some one recalled the old joke
about the recruit who was rejected because of
poor teeth. He had said he wanted to shoot the
enemy, not to bite ’em!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>But, after all, a soldier’s digestion depends in
a great measure on his ability to chew often not
tender food. And among the few true things
said about war is that “an army fights on its
stomach.” No soldier can be a first-class one if
he has such bad teeth that he cannot chew well.</p>

<p>It was a most searching examination, and no one
knew whether he had passed or not, for the doctors
merely looked wise and jotted down notes on
papers before them.</p>

<p>However, it developed during the day that some
of the candidates had been rejected as physically
unfit, and as Tom and his two chums received no
notification that they had not passed, they took it
for granted that they had gone through—as they
had.</p>

<p>In due time came the mental examinations. It
was a grilling experience for all, and a number of
lads were on the verge of nervous breakdown before
it was over.</p>

<p>However, Tom had made an excellent preparation
and he felt sure he had gone through, if not
with flying colors, at least on a safe margin. The
examination was more severe than he had imagined
it would be.</p>

<p>Several days were consumed in getting through
with the examinations, as nothing was done hurriedly.
The candidates were kept to themselves
during this period, and though the upper classmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
were forbidden to come to the barracks while
the candidates were there, the rule was often violated,
and mild hazing was indulged in, especially
in the bathrooms. Some of the boys were made to
give an imitation of swimming, as they lay face
downward on a chair.</p>

<p>It was one day, after a particularly hard examination,
that Tom went in to freshen up with a
bath. As he undressed he was suddenly seized by
a couple of yearlings, one of whom yelled in his
ear:</p>

<p>“Now for the slide for life!”</p>

<p>“Chuck that water on the floor,” said the other
cadet to Tom, who emptied a pail on the tiles of
the bathroom.</p>

<p>“Now slide!” cried the two together. Deftly
they tripped Tom up. He fell rather heavily, and
was given a shove that carried him across the slippery,
wet floor up against the other side of the
bathroom with a force that jarred the breath from
him, and made him feel sick and dizzy. Tom’s
head swam and black spots danced before his eyes.
He feared he was going to faint, but held himself
back from the brink with an effort, as he heard a
sharp voice saying:</p>

<p>“Here! That’s enough! Don’t you know
what’ll happen if you’re caught at that?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br><span class="small">CAPTAIN HAWKESBURY</span></h2></div>


<p>Tom managed to stand up, though he felt weak
and dizzy. He saw rather sheepish looks on the
faces of the two yearlings who had begun to haze
him. Behind them stood one of the older cadets.</p>

<p>“You’d better go,” he said to the two hazers.
Then of Tom he asked in not unkindly tone: “Are
you all right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” Tom answered, saluting, though
had it not been for the pain of bruises he would
have felt like laughing, standing at attention as
he was, ready for his bath.</p>

<p>The older cadet said nothing more. Doubtless
he understood. For hazing at West Point is severely
prohibited now, though doubtless a mild
form goes on more or less surreptitiously.</p>

<p>Tom took a hot bath, which made him feel better,
and when he had gone under the stinging
shower he was braced up sufficiently to make him
almost forget his painful bruises, for they did
hurt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>Our hero did not feel any resentment against
the lads who had started him on the “slide for
life,” as it used to be called. It was part of the
game, though a forbidden part. And Tom knew
better than to make a fuss about it. His life
would have been miserable from then on had he
done so.</p>

<p>After all, hazing, if not too severe and if it is
unaccompanied by indignities that lower one’s
self-respect, has its use in the world. It teaches
a young man certain lessons that are hard to drill
into him in other ways. But hazing, as it is often
done in schools and colleges, is sometimes a silly
performance, and sometimes a positively harmful
proceeding.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Tom?” asked Harry
Houston, a little later, as the three new chums
were in their barrack room. “You walk lame.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I got a little bump in the bathroom,”
Tom answered, evasively.</p>

<p>“Huh! I think I can guess how,” said Sam.
“I didn’t have it so easy yesterday, myself. But
it’s all in the day’s work.”</p>

<p>The next day was the last of the examinations,
and there were evidences of relief on all sides.
But still there was the haunting fear in the heart
of every candidate that he had not passed. It
would be about two days before the results would
be announced, and those two days are, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
filled with more agony than any others in the life
of a West Pointer, except, it may be, when the
final examinations come.</p>

<p>During the two days of waiting there had been
little to occupy the attention of the candidates.
They were obliged to keep to their rooms most
of the time, and dismal enough it was, too. But
there was no help for it.</p>

<p>“I do wish they’d hurry up and end the suspense,”
cried Harry one day when it was rumored
that the results were to be made known that afternoon.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s like keeping a fellow on pins and
needles all the while,” agreed Sam.</p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Tom, rising to his feet.
“I think—”</p>

<p>“Candidates turn out promptly!” came an order,
interrupting him. “Turn out!”</p>

<p>“They’re going to make the announcements,”
Sam said, and his hands trembled as he reached
for his cap.</p>

<p>Tom said nothing, but gritted his teeth. If he
had failed—well, he had made a brave attempt.</p>

<p>Downstairs went the candidates, all of them
eagerly anxious, and perhaps not one but was nervously
anxious. Their faces showed the strain
they were under.</p>

<p>In the area they were formed in a single rank,
while in front of them stood the adjutant of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
Academy—the same one to whom Tom and the
others had reported the first day of their arrival.</p>

<p>He announced that those whose names he
called were to step two paces to the front, the
others were to maintain their place in the ranks.
The name-calling followed immediately, in alphabetical
order, and, one after another, certain lads
stepped out. Tom’s name would come far down
on the list. He listened when the “H” division
was reached, but Houston’s was not called. Nor
was Leland’s. And the adjutant went through
the “T” column without mentioning Tom.</p>

<p>Our hero was puzzled. Had he failed? Why
had his name not been called if he passed? No
one seemed to understand what it was all about
or what system was being followed.</p>

<p>Finally the reading was over. In front, two
paces in advance of one line, stood another row
of cadets. The front rank was the smaller in
number.</p>

<p>Then, with wildly-beating hearts, Tom and the
others listened to the words of the adjutant.
Those whose names had been called, he stated,
had failed in their examinations, and could not
continue at the Academy. They would turn in
their equipment and withdraw. The others would
remain, and start on their four years’ training to
become army officers.</p>

<p>“Then I’ve passed!” Tom said, exultantly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
himself. “I’ve passed and Clarence hasn’t!”</p>

<p>He wanted to laugh, to shout and yell at his
good fortune. Not that he wanted to gloat over
the failure of young Hawkesbury. It was just
that Tom was fully alive to what it meant to him
to have succeeded.</p>

<p>There was a deep silence following the announcement
of the adjutant. Doubtless others of
the successful ones than Tom wanted to laugh
and shout, but they had to refrain. And probably
those who had failed had hard work to keep back
the tears of disappointment. For after all, they
were only boys around seventeen years of age,
and disappointment is keener than later, just as
success is more sweet.</p>

<p>But it was all very cold and impartial at the
West Point Academy. No one congratulated the
successful ones, though when ranks were broken
they did exult among themselves. And there was
small comfort for the losers, most of whom, however,
accepted it gamely.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I don’t have to go through the four
years’ grind,” said one lad, who, it was rumored,
was quite wealthy. “I’m going out West on a
ranch now, and do some real living.”</p>

<p>Later on, when hard work came, Tom often
envied him. But Tom was not going to turn back
now.</p>

<p>“Well, old man, we made it!” said Harry, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
he shook Tom’s hand, once they were in their
room again.</p>

<p>“That’s what we did!” declared Sam. “Oh,
but I was shaky!”</p>

<p>“So was I,” Tom admitted, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Those who had been “found”—which means
they had lost the examination—lost little time in
turning in their belongings, and taking the train
back to their homes. Some declared they would
make another attempt next year, while others
went off, sullenly angry.</p>

<p>“And now for uniforms!” exclaimed Harry, a
little later. “No more ‘cits,’ for at least two
years, when we get our first furlough.” The
clothes Tom and his chums had worn up to this
time had been those they brought from home.
They were the attire of civilians, or citizens, which
last word has been abbreviated to “cits” by the
cadets.</p>

<p>“We’ll get any old sort of a uniform now,”
said Sam, who had been forewarned. “Later on
we’ll be measured for one that fits, and then
melted and poured into it.”</p>

<p>Indeed so well did the clothes of the cadets fit
them that the simile of Sam was not inappropriate.</p>

<p>Each of the successful candidates received two
pairs of uniform shoes, two pairs of gray flannel
trousers, a gray blouse and a cap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“Now we really are somebody!” exclaimed
Tom, with a sigh of content as he surveyed himself
in the small mirror allowed in their room.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, it’s a beginning,” said Sam.</p>

<p>The next day they were marched to headquarters,
to take the oath of allegiance to the United
States, to serve for eight years, unless sooner discharged.
Each lad had to pay a twenty-five cent
fee to an old clerk, who acted as notary public
in administering the oath.</p>

<p>It was when Tom and the others were coming
from drill, a few days later, with aching shoulders
and legs—for the ordeal had been severe—that
our hero received a surprise.</p>

<p>With his chums he was passing along the parade
ground, when he saw approaching an officer
whose figure seemed vaguely familiar. The
“plebes” saluted as they passed him. Tom had
a look at his face.</p>

<p>“Captain Hawkesbury!” murmured Tom, under
his breath. “What can he be doing here?”
he asked Sam, as he passed on, getting a sharp
look from the glittering eyes of Clarence’s uncle.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“That officer—Captain Hawkesbury,” Tom
went on, indicating the man they had just passed.</p>

<p>“Oh, him. Why he’s been assigned here from
the regular army, I heard, to give special instruction.
Why, do you know him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and I—I wish I didn’t,” murmured
Tom. He felt a vague sense of foreboding.
What would the presence of Captain Hawkesbury
mean to our hero at West Point, when Tom had
been successful over the officer’s favorite nephew?
Tom was apprehensive.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br><span class="small">ANTICIPATIONS</span></h2></div>


<p>“This certainly isn’t any cinch!”</p>

<p>“I should say not! It’s the hardest grind I
was ever up against!”</p>

<p>“Well, you didn’t expect to live in a perpetual
camp, with nothing to do; did you?”</p>

<p>It was Sam Leland who gave utterance to the
first remark, and Harry Houston who spoke the
second, with a doleful shake of his head. And it
was Tom Taylor who propounded the question.</p>

<p>The three new cadets, as our three friends were
officially designated, though in reality they were
called plebes, and would be for the next year to
come, were in their barrack room, having just
come in from a long and tiresome drill. They
were taking what ease they could before they
would again be called upon to take up some other
of their new military duties.</p>

<p>“Camp! I should say it wasn’t like camp!”
exclaimed Sam. Shortly before the three chums
had been telling one another some of their experiences<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
before they came to West Point, and all
had agreed that the fun they had had while camping
in the summer was best of all.</p>

<p>“Oh well, we’ll have a taste of camp life here,”
observed Harry, as he looked around the room,
to make sure it was in perfect order against the
unexpected inspection of some “tac.”</p>

<p>“Yes we’ll have a taste of it, and that’s about
all!” Tom went on. “We’ll have to drill harder
than we do now, and we’ll have to wait on some
of the upper classmen like slaves.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, I suppose it’s good for what ails us,”
said Sam, with a sigh. “If the others went
through with it I guess we can stand it.”</p>

<p>“There’s no getting out of it. We’re here for
four years, if we’re lucky enough to stick,” Tom
ventured. “After all, we won’t always be in the
awkward squad.”</p>

<p>“We were lucky enough not to be put in the
‘goats,’” remarked Sam. “Well, I’m going to
take it easy. Listen if you hear any one coming,”
and he took a restful position that would not allow
him to spring easily to attention in case of the
unexpected entrance of a “tac,” but he depended
on the sharp ears of his companions to warn him.</p>

<p>The boys, as I have said, had just come in from
some hard drilling. This necessary instruction
had begun as soon as they had formally been
sworn in as subjects of the United States. Four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
hours a day were devoted to “setting-up” exercises,
the drill-masters being cadets from the upper
classes, each one of whom was given charge
over eight plebes.</p>

<p>And stern drill-masters they were, too, though
perhaps not more so than the necessity required.
Certainly a plebe is very awkward, compared with
the military uprightness, sprightliness and precision
of the finished cadet.</p>

<p>Tom never told his mother all he suffered, mentally
and physically, during those first few weeks
when he was being given the rudiments of a military
education. He and his two companions
who roomed together were forced to march here
and there, back and forth, in all sorts of primary
formations. They had to walk with chins drawn
in, stomachs pulled up, with shoulders farther
back than it seemed possible to force them, and
they must never suffer themselves to slump out of
this tiresome position. At least it was tiresome
then, though later it became a fixed posture, that
the trained cadet assumed naturally.</p>

<p>Then they had to march under a hot sun, and
before the eyes of such chance visitors and excursionists
as came to West Point, and these visitors
did not always restrain their smiles or laughter
at the antics of the awkward squad.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see how some of them would like
it,” complained Tom, after a particularly hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
drill, when he and his chums had detected a bevy
of pretty girls smiling at them.</p>

<p>“They’ll be glad enough, later, to have us ask
’em to a hop,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Huh! Catch me asking any of them!” commented
Harry, vindictively.</p>

<p>It is no wonder the boys were mentally depressed
the first few days after their ordeal began—mentally
depressed and physically weary.
They tried to realize that it was all for their good,
but it was not easy.</p>

<p>“I thought we’d have some larks when we
came here,” observed Sam. “All the stories I
ever read about life at West Point were lively.”</p>

<p>“I guess some of the fellows who wrote those
stories never came up as far as Newburgh,”
sighed Tom. “It isn’t very lively.”</p>

<p>It certainly was not. The new cadets did not
have as much fun as they would have had at a
boarding school or a college where there was not
so much discipline. But on the one hand, this
strict discipline was necessary as the basis of a
military education, and on the other hand, there
was scarcely a plebe who had the mental or physical
energy to go out after any fun at the close
of a day’s drill, provided such fun could have
been had without undue risk.</p>

<p>In fact, there was not much that could be done
in the way of outside fun those first few weeks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Every hour of the new cadet’s life must be accounted
for. His comings and goings had to be
reported on the second. His superior officers
must know where he was, and what he was doing,
every minute of the day or night. And it was
too much of a risk to “take any chances.”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll get the guns, to-day,” observed
Tom, one morning about a week after they had
begun to receive their drill instructions.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“I heard some of the officers talking about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, it will be something new to occupy us,”
went on Sam.</p>

<p>“Yes, another load to carry around in the
broiling sun,” said Harry, with a groan. “Just
as if we didn’t have enough now. Say, fellows,”
he went on, with a sigh, “do I bend over backwards
when I stand up?” and he stood up straight
and turned slowly around.</p>

<p>“Bend over backwards? What do you mean?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I mean I’ve been hollered at so much to
‘straighten up’ that I’m sure I must be getting
curvature of the spine the wrong way.”</p>

<p>“They certainly do throw it into us,” observed
Tom, sympathetically.</p>

<p>“All that fierce drill-master of ours can think
to call us is ‘wooden’ and ‘gross’,” went on
Harry. “I’m sick of the sound of it. But maybe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
if we get the guns it won’t be so bad. It’ll be
a change, anyhow, and give ’em a chance to ring
in some new terms of abuse.”</p>

<p>Up to now the new cadets had drilled without
weapons. But that day, as Tom had anticipated,
rifles were issued to those farthest advanced, including
our three friends. The “plebes” were
divided into squads, the least proficient being
dubbed “goats” and Tom and his chums rejoiced
that this was not their fate.</p>

<p>It was the first day of the drill with arms, and
what little knowledge the boys seemed to have
previously acquired appeared to be oozing away
from them, as they were told how to handle the
rifles.</p>

<p>The cadet drill-master waxed wroth, and when
Tom saw, coming toward the squad he was in,
Captain Hawkesbury, with a look of contempt
on his flushed face, our hero thought to himself:</p>

<p>“Here’s where we get it.”</p>

<p>And they did. The old army officer, whatever
else he was, was a good soldier and disciplinarian,
and he and the cadet officer put the plebes through
their paces without mercy.</p>

<p>Whether it was Tom’s fault or not, or whether
Captain Hawkesbury singled him out, was not
apparent, but, at any rate, Tom received more
reprimands than any of the others. Captain
Hawkesbury spoke sharply, almost insultingly, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
that even the cadet lieutenant looked surprised.
But Captain Hawkesbury was his superior officer,
having been engaged for just such special instruction
work.</p>

<p>“He sure has it in for me,” mused Tom, after
an especially sharp rebuke. “I’ve got to expect
a lot of this, I suppose, because I beat Clarence
out in the test. I wonder where Clarence is, anyhow?”</p>

<p>The nephew had left West Point when it became
apparent that Tom had made good, and he
had not been seen since.</p>

<p>Again and again Captain Hawkesbury, either
intentionally or otherwise, showed his enmity
against Tom as the day’s drilling proceeded. And
it culminated when Tom made a slight mistake in
following a complicated order.</p>

<p>“Mr. Taylor, you seem deliberately trying to
do this wrong!” snapped Captain Hawkesbury.
“Report at my office after dismissal!”</p>

<p>Tom knew better than to show any resentment.
But when he left his chums to obey the command
later, his heart was filled with apprehensions.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br><span class="small">A LARK</span></h2></div>


<p>Captain Hawkesbury received Tom with a
grim smile. In his heart Tom felt a deep dislike
for this man who, in some manner or other, had
so profited by Mr. Taylor’s tangled property affairs.</p>

<p>It was an open secret in and around Chester
that Captain Hawkesbury and Aaron Doolittle
had made a small fortune simply out of the sale
of the land to the railroad company, for instead
of taking all cash they had been given certain
shares in the company, which shares had doubled
in value very shortly.</p>

<p>“And my mother might have had those shares
if things—well, if things had gone differently,”
mused Tom. “I wonder if there’s any chance of
ever getting back part of that money—or having
a claim on the land which the railroad company
would have to settle for with us?”</p>

<p>Tom had often had these thoughts, but he was
no day-dreamer, and the hard realities of life left
him little time to indulge in such speculations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“I guess I’ll just have to grind along until I
graduate,” he mused. “Then I may make enough
so that mother won’t have to work any more.”</p>

<p>He, as well as the other cadets at West Point,
was paid a small salary while studying, the money
being held for them until the completion of their
four years’ service.</p>

<p>“I’ll have that to start with, anyhow,” Tom
reasoned, as he faced the grim old army officer.</p>

<p>“Mr. Taylor,” began Captain Hawkesbury, in
rasping tones, “you don’t seem to show the right
spirit at drill.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I didn’t mean to do anything out of
the way, sir,” Tom replied, after his salute.</p>

<p>“Don’t answer me back!” was the snapping
retort. “You haven’t a good carriage. I think
I can improve it. Stand up straight now and I’ll
give you some exercises. Straighter!” was the
sharp order, and Tom threw back his shoulders
until he had a pain in the middle of his back.</p>

<p>And then for over an hour Captain Hawkesbury
made him stand in a strained position, at
times ordering him to go through certain exercises,
more tiring than the standing. And all the
while there was a mean grin on the face of the
crabbed old man. He seemed to take delight in
Tom’s discomfiture, and no doubt he did. He was
strictly within his rights—Tom knew that—but,
none the less, our hero was sure the ordeal he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
to go through was devised solely as a personal
punishment to gratify the spleen of Captain
Hawkesbury because Tom had defeated the captain’s
nephew.</p>

<p>Tom was as limp as a rag when he was allowed
to go back to his room, and his chums commiserated
with him as he told them of what he had
gone through.</p>

<p>“The old scab!” ejaculated Sam.</p>

<p>“We ought to haze him!” declared Harry.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you won’t get a chance to do that,”
Tom said. “The only thing for me to do is to
keep as much out of his way as possible. And
that isn’t going to be easy. This is certainly
fierce!” and he drooped his aching shoulders to
ease them from the long strain.</p>

<p>“Cheer up! There’s a little relief in sight,”
Harry said.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Tom asked.</p>

<p>“Orders have been published saying we’re to
go to camp. It will be different there, at least.”</p>

<p>“Good!” Tom cried, animation showing on
his face. “It’s getting too hot in barracks.”</p>

<p>The new cadets had had three weeks of almost
constant drilling, in setting-up exercises, marching,
and the manual of arms; and now came a change.
Each lad received four pairs of white duck trousers,
in anticipation of camp life, at least that number
being necessary to enable them to look neat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
for the white material soiled quickly, and neatness
is one of the fundamental requirements at
West Point.</p>

<p>Up to now the new cadets had not mingled in
the least with the upper classmen. There would
be no association for the following year, it being
the policy at the Military Academy to keep the
first-year men separated from the second, third
and fourth year classes. But though there would
be no mingling there would be more or less association
in camp with the third and fourth year
men. The second class was on furlough, there
being but one during the four years’ course, coming
at the conclusion of the second year.</p>

<p>Divided into companies, according to the
height of the men, Tom and his friends were
marched over to camp, where the white tents, in
precise rows, nestled under the shade of the maple
trees near the banks of the historic Hudson. The
“plebes” had been looking toward it for some
time with longing eyes, but it was a place they
were forbidden to approach until sent there to
spend part of the summer receiving instruction.</p>

<p>With brooms, buckets, bedding and personal
property, the new cadets tramped over the cavalry
plain toward the rows of cool and inviting-looking
tents. Naturally the arrival of the
“plebes” attracted the attention of the upper
classmen, who indulged in all manner of good-natured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
gibes against the unfortunates. This
went on until the new lads were divided off into
different companies.</p>

<p>As but two cadets would occupy the same tent
Tom, Harry and Sam were to be separated. But
only one tent apart, they were glad to note. Tom
and Sam bunked together, while Harry went in
with a lad named Chad Wilson, from New Jersey,
a lad to whom Tom and his chums had taken
a great liking.</p>

<p>“Well, now let’s get straightened out,” Tom
suggested to Sam as they piled their belongings
on the floor of the tent. Some of the older cadets
kindly showed our friends how to sling their
“stretchers,” a canvas holder that hung from
the ridge-pole of the tent. In this stretcher is
put clothing and everything that cannot be gotten
in the lockers that stand on the floor. The tent
of Tom and Sam was soon in proper and perfect
shape for inspection.</p>

<p>“Say, they’re all right—those fellows!” exclaimed
Sam, as the two upper classmen left, having
spent some time showing him and Tom how
to arrange their tent. “I like them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let ’em know it,” advised Tom.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because they’ll freeze to us and make us
their ‘special duty’ men. They probably will
anyhow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“What’s ‘special duty’ men?” Sam wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out soon enough.”</p>

<p>And Sam did. A little later he and Tom were
detailed to keep in order the tent of the two third-year
cadets who had showed them how to arrange
their bedding that first day. And for the remainder
of that camp the two “plebes” were obliged
to do all sorts of services for the upper classmen,
from making contraband lemonade to going on
errands and writing their less important letters.</p>

<p>In exchange the protection of the upper-class
cadets was thrown around their special duty men.
No other cadet was allowed to utilize their services,
nor even to haze them mildly. And Tom
and Sam also were given much friendly advice,
help in their studies, and acquired some cast-off,
but very good, clothing that came in very handy
for lads whose spending money was limited.</p>

<p>So life at camp began, and it was a welcome
change, in a way, from the former system of drilling.
Not that it was any easier, for the plebes
had much to learn. More than once did Tom
fall under the stern eye of Captain Hawkesbury
who seemed to single our hero out for special reproof.</p>

<p>One day when Tom was sent to the old army
officer’s tent, he saw, on a table amid a pile of
other letters, one that bore the scrawling signature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
of Aaron Doolittle. A puff of wind blew
the epistle to the floor, and Tom, who picked it
up, could not help seeing part of one sentence.</p>

<p>These words seemed fairly to stare out at him:
“The Railroad Company is not altogether satisfied
about bridge land title. We’ll have to get
together on it soon.”</p>

<p>“Now what in the world can that mean?”
thought Tom, as he placed the letter back with the
others. “If I could only get a good lawyer to
take up our case I might find there was something
coming to my mother from that land. But I guess
it isn’t of much use. Poor mother! If Captain
Hawkesbury knows anything about any money
due us he’s keeping it mighty secret.”</p>

<p>But Tom’s speculations concerning the strange
meaning of the sentence in the letter were brought
to an abrupt end, at least for the time being, that
same night.</p>

<p>There had been hard and gruelling drill, and a
mild spirit of revolt was abroad among some of
the “plebes.” Word was passed around that a
lark was in prospect. Some of the boys were going
to play a trick on one or two of the sentries.
Tom had a chance to go in on it but refused, and
he was glad, later, that he had stayed out.</p>

<p>For the lark was a fizzle. The sentries had
been informed beforehand about the trick, and
nearly captured those who intended to take their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
guns away from them. The officer of the day, the
officer of the guard and the sergeant came out on
the alarm and a chase of the luckless cadets resulted.</p>

<p>Tom was in his tent when Sam entered hurriedly,
barely managing to slip in past the sentinel
in the Company street.</p>

<p>“Narrow squeak!” Sam murmured. “Mum’s
the word, Tom, old man.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Tom answered. In the next tent he
could hear Harry and Chad going in hurriedly,
to undress and get into bed before a general inspection
was made.</p>

<p>And hardly had Sam pulled the clothes over
him before one of the sentries with a dark-lantern
came in.</p>

<p>Sam gave an audible snore, and Tom followed
his example.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br><span class="small">TOM’S REFUSAL</span></h2></div>


<p>“Mighty good sleepers in here!” muttered
the sentry as he flashed his lantern in the faces of
Tom and Sam. “Mighty good!”</p>

<p>He was an experienced man, and, doubtless
had played the same trick himself many a time.
He stooped and looked under the cots where the
shoes of the “plebes” should have been. Tom
knew what was going on and he felt sure that
Sam must have left his soil-begrimed shoes in
plain sight.</p>

<p>But Tom had not given his tent-mate credit for
some common sense. Sam had guessed that shoes
would be looked at, since there was some mud
about the camp that day. So Sam had put his
shoes in his locker, and had taken out a clean pair
which he put at the foot of his cot.</p>

<p>The sentry grunted as he detected no signs of
mud on the leather, and again flashed his light in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the faces of the two lads, having, by a quick look,
ascertained that the tent was in proper order.</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted the sentry, as he was about to
leave, baffled.</p>

<p>“Eh? What’s that? Who’s here? What’s the
trouble?” asked Sam, pretending to awaken suddenly
and blinking his eyes at the light. “I say,
Tom!” he went on, with an air of innocence that
became him well. “Something’s going on all
right!”</p>

<p>“There’ll be more before there’s less,” growled
the sentry. “Mighty innocent, you two!”</p>

<p>He went out and Tom and Sam refrained from
talk for some time, for they realized that he might
come sneaking softly back to overhear any words
that might give him a clue.</p>

<p>At last, however, as several minutes passed, and
nothing happened, Sam ventured to whisper, and
told Tom all that had occurred. Though Tom
was not in on the lark he had all the facts, and
knew those who had taken part in it.</p>

<p>For some time search went on through the
streets of white tents but, as far as could be
learned, none of the culprits was discovered.
Finally quiet settled down over the camp, and
Tom and Sam really slept.</p>

<p>The next morning, of course, there was an effort
made to discover those responsible for the
attempted outrage, as Captain Hawkesbury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
termed it. He was one of the chief investigators,
and he stormed around, telling what he would do
to the culprits when he discovered them.</p>

<p>“But first you’ve got to catch them,” murmured
Harry, who had, like Sam, escaped by a
narrow margin. “Nobody will peach.”</p>

<p>Of course that was not to be thought of, and
the code of morals at West Point would allow of
no lying. If any of the guilty ones had been
asked directly if he had taken part in the fracas
of the night, not one would have denied it.</p>

<p>But it was not the policy of the investigators to
ask the direct question. They wanted to be in a
position to make an accusation, have the necessary
evidence, and then mete out the just punishment.
That is, it was the policy of all but one
man, and that was the old army officer, Captain
Hawkesbury. Whether he had forgotten the code
of morals to which he had formerly subscribed
when at West Point or whether he chose to ignore
it, was not plain.</p>

<p>At any rate he seemed determined to find out,
by hook or crook, who were the guilty ones, and
he took the meanest method of doing this. He
sent for Tom and demanded to know of him
whether or not Sam, Harry or Chad had had a
part in the night’s lark.</p>

<p>At first Tom was too surprised to answer.
Though he had not been long at West Point he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
realized that this questioning, to make one cadet
report on another, was without precedent.</p>

<p>“I refuse to answer, Captain Hawkesbury,”
Tom said.</p>

<p>“What! You dare refuse me?”</p>

<p>“I feel that I must.”</p>

<p>“Then you know some of the guilty ones?”
and the old officer leered up into Tom’s face.</p>

<p>“I refuse to answer that also.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do you any good. I have positive
information that you know the guilty ones, and I
demand that you give me their names!”</p>

<p>“And I, much as I regret it, respectfully refuse,”
said Tom, firmly.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll make you tell!” declared the captain
in angry passion.</p>

<p>Tom felt that he was in trouble.</p>

<p>For a moment or two the man who had so benefited
by Tom’s father’s money—legally or illegally—seemed
to be considering the case. Then,
he appeared to make up his mind.</p>

<p>“Six hours of guard duty as a starter!” he
snapped. “If that doesn’t bring you to your
senses I’ll try something else. If you want to
tell,” he went on, in a wheedling tone, “I will be
in a position to get you some special privileges.
Perhaps even a furlough.”</p>

<p>This was almost unheard of for a plebe, and
Tom knew it. He also knew that Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Hawkesbury had some underhand power, but
whether he could exert it over army officers, however
much he might with politicians, was a matter
of conjecture.</p>

<p>“Are you going to tell?” he demanded, banging
his fist down on his table so that the papers
danced.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Tom, quietly.</p>

<p>“Then go on guard! I’ll see you later!” was
the cold retort.</p>

<p>Doing guard duty on a hot day, in a stiff uniform,
carrying a heavy gun in the broiling sun,
is not an easy task. Tom found it very trying,
but not for an instant did he falter in his determination
to refuse to tell what he knew.</p>

<p>His companions waxed indignant, and there
was a hurried meeting of the “plebes.” The
guilty ones offered to confess to save Tom from
further punishment, but he heard of it, and refused
to accept the sacrifice.</p>

<p>“I can stick it out!” he said.</p>

<p>“But what if there is more to come?” asked
Sam. “He may lock you up as a prisoner, and
cut off every privilege.”</p>

<p>“Let him,” said Tom.</p>

<p>But Captain Hawkesbury did not go that far.
Whether he dared not, or whether those higher in
authority stepped in and released Tom, never
became known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Certain it was that Tom was relieved from
guard duty, and nothing was said about further
punishment. He went to his tent worn out and
weary, but his spirit was not broken, and he had
not told.</p>

<p>“But he’ll be more my enemy than ever,”
mused Tom, for he felt that the old army officer
would be chagrined that he could not inflict some
punishment on the guilty ones.</p>

<p>However, those taking part in the frolic, were
never officially known, and the matter passed into
West Point history, with other similar cases.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the drill work at the camp went
on, and Tom was beginning to feel that he was
slowly getting on to the road which would lead
him to his place as an officer in the United States
army. From time to time he wondered how his
mother was getting on. He had letters, of course,
and they seemed to be bright and cheery ones.
But Tom knew that even if she suffered she would
write that way.</p>

<p>“Hang it all!” he would exclaim. “If I could
only get hold of some money for her—some of
the money I feel sure father must have left. But
where is it?”</p>

<p>Then would come the memory of that letter in
the tent of Captain Hawkesbury.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br><span class="small">ACROSS THE RIVER</span></h2></div>


<p>The Fourth of July was looked forward to
by all the cadets, the plebes no less than the upper
classmen. To all it meant a day when most of the
duties were suspended, and to the “plebes” it
marked the time when some of them, for the first
time, would be chosen to go on guard. Not all
the plebes would be selected for this, but Tom
learned that he and Sam would be. Harry and
Chad had to wait a while for the coveted honor.</p>

<p>On the morning of Independence Day, following
an old-time custom, the West Point band
marched through the streets of tents at reveille.
After this all duties were suspended for the day.
A patriotic concert was given in the morning, with
the firing of a national salute at noon, and then
came an extra good dinner served in honor of the
occasion.</p>

<p>Few and far between were the privileges accorded
the plebes, those most lowly of the West
Pointers. But in some manner, on this Independence
Day, unusual permission was given to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
lowest division of cadets to go, with certain restrictions,
where they pleased in the afternoon,
provided they were back by a certain hour.</p>

<p>“Say, this hits me just about right!” exclaimed
Sam to Tom, as the two came back to their tent
after dinner. “What do you say that we get a
boat and go across the river to Garrison and feel
as if we could call our souls our own for a while.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you, if it’ll be allowed,” said Tom.
“Sure it’ll be allowed!” his chum asserted.
“We’ll get Harry and Chad, hire a boat, and
have a real lark for once.”</p>

<p>“Go as far as you like,” laughed Tom, “only
I haven’t got much cash.”</p>

<p>“We don’t need much. I have plenty, as it
happens—just by luck more than anything else,”
he added quickly. For he was the son of a wealthy
broker, and had much spending money. However,
a “plebe” has little chance to spend money,
so Tom was no worse off than any of his companions.
In fact, in spite of what is said about the
democracy of many colleges, it is only at West
Point that the absolute lack of money makes no
difference at all. Money is really not given a
consideration. It is comradeship, worth, and
brains that count.</p>

<p>Never since he had arrived had Tom, even for
a moment, been made to feel that he was looked
down on because of his poverty. And he had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
doubt but that his lack of spending money was
well known to all his companions.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a bang-up good time!” went on
Sam. “All the ice cream and lemonade we want
for once!”</p>

<p>Both he and Tom were very mild in their desire
for pleasures, as were Harry and Chad. The
two latter eagerly welcomed the chance to get
away for a while from the daily grind, and the
necessary permission having been secured, they
went to hire the boat to row across the Hudson.</p>

<p>As yet Tom had had little opportunity to look
at the many points of interest around West Point,
with its Revolutionary associations, and the part
it played in the treason of Arnold. He made up
his mind that some day he would take the time
to visit all these spots and see those which history
had made famous.</p>

<p>The four chums started off together, bent on
having a good time. Money rattled in the pockets
of Sam, at least. As a matter of fact, cadets
are not supposed to have any cash. Things they
need are charged against their monthly salary,
and should they desire a picture taken, or wish to
buy some candy, they have to submit a permit
credit for the necessary amount. Thus the real
need of money is done away with. But of course
every cadet is more or less surreptitiously supplied
by his family, so that occasionally a bit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
“boodle” may be purchased, that being the cadet
term for all contraband eatables.</p>

<p>Our friends were not the only ones who went
to the river for a row that pleasant Fourth of
July. But only a few, including Tom and his
three chums, went to Garrison.</p>

<p>How they enjoyed the delights of doing, in a
measure, as they pleased, without having to march
along as stiff as ramrods, without having some
corporal yell “more yet” in their ears, meaning
thereby to straighten up more yet, or draw
in their chins more yet—how they enjoyed the
delights of this freedom may easily be imagined.</p>

<p>They laughed and joked, made fun of each
other and their fellow cadets, talked as familiarly
as they liked of their superior officers, from the
“Supe,” as the superintendent of the Academy
and the highest official is known, down to the
“Com,” or commandant of cadets.</p>

<p>It was all pure joy and delight—at least for a
time.</p>

<p>Reaching Garrison the boys tied up their boat
and made their way through the streets of the
town. They met several other cadets—upper
classmen, but the latter took no notice of the
“plebes” nor did the latter dare so much as look
at the “superior beings.” Such has custom decreed.</p>

<p>“This looks like a good place to go in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
have a feed of ice cream,” suggested Sam, as
they passed a place where tables were set in the
open air under some trees and vines growing over
a pergola.</p>

<p>“Go to it,” advised Tom. “I’m hot and dry.”</p>

<p>They marched in and gave their orders, noticing
as they did so that the ice cream garden joined
one attached to a cafe, where something stronger
than water and grape juice was sold.</p>

<p>Somewhat to the surprise of Tom and his
chums they saw several older cadets in this other
summer garden, sitting about tables drinking and
smoking.</p>

<p>“They’re hitting the pace,” murmured Harry.</p>

<p>“Yes, but don’t let them see us looking at
them,” advised Tom. “It won’t do, you know.”</p>

<p>The “plebes” knew their places well.</p>

<p>The four friends were enjoying their cream,
and wondering what next they could do to help
pass the day, when Tom, whose back was toward
the cafe garden, heard his name spoken loudly.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” some one exclaimed.</p>

<p>Tom looked around and saw Clarence Hawkesbury
at a table where sat some upper classmen.</p>

<p>Clarence seemed a bit unsteady on his feet.
His face was flushed and he pointed a wavering
finger at Tom.</p>

<p>“There he is!” he said. “There’s the fellow
who did me out of my trick at West Point. If it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
wasn’t for him I’d be with you now—with you,
my friends,” and he waved his hand to include the
older cadets.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” some of them advised him. Others
laughed. They were all rather noisy and hilarious.</p>

<p>“I—I’ll fix him,” Clarence continued.</p>

<p>Young Hawkesbury strode over toward Tom’s
table.</p>

<p>“He’s coming,” said Sam in a low voice.
“Want to duck out?”</p>

<p>“I did not!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s right—stick! We’re with you!”
Chad said.</p>

<p>“I’ll fix him!” Clarence muttered.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on back! Sit down! Don’t be
foolish!” his friends advised him. But Clarence
was hot-headed just then. Unsteadily, he strode
over to Tom’s chair. By this time Tom had
arisen, for there was a foreboding look of anger
on the face of his enemy.</p>

<p>“There! That’s one I owe you!” Clarence exclaimed.
He aimed a blow at Tom. It only fell
lightly, but Tom was not one to take a blow like
that and not reply.</p>

<p>The next instant his fist shot out, met the chin
of Clarence squarely with a resounding crack,
and the insulting youth fell backward on the
grass, lying prone.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br><span class="small">AN EXPLOSION</span></h2></div>


<p>So suddenly had the “fracas,” as the boys referred
to it afterward, taken place, that for the
moment no one, not even Tom, knew what to do
or say. They all remained, in strained attitudes
of surprise, looking at Clarence.</p>

<p>Tom had acted instinctively in striking out, the
instinct that causes every lad to want to hit back,
once he is hit. In reality there was little of real
anger back of Tom’s blow. But it had been effective,
that was evident.</p>

<p>“He certainly can hit some,” one of the older
cadets remarked in a low voice.</p>

<p>“A good, straight blow,” murmured another.</p>

<p>As yet, strictly following precedent, the upper
classmen had given no indication that they so
much as knew a “plebe” existed.</p>

<p>Clarence now sat up slowly, with a dazed look
on his face. Some of his companions could not
refrain from smiling. They did not altogether
sympathize with Clarence, it seemed. It developed
afterward that they were certain wealthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
cadets whose acquaintance young Hawkesbury
had made the previous summer at a fashionable
resort.</p>

<p>“Who—who hit me?” Clarence demanded, as
he rubbed his chin, on which showed a dull red
mark.</p>

<p>“I did,” Tom answered, not a whit afraid. He
was quite willing to do the same thing over again
if he had to.</p>

<p>“Oh, you—you hit me—did you?” went on
Clarence. His brain seemed dull of comprehension.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tom. “But you struck me first,
if you remember.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I did, eh? Well, I’ll hit you again,
that’s what I will. I’ll show you—”</p>

<p>Clarence struggled to his feet, but some of the
cadets with him gathered around him.</p>

<p>“Say, you don’t know enough to quit when
you’ve had enough,” said one. “He’ll only knock
you down again. You’re in no condition to
fight.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Hawkesbury. Take it easy,”
advised another. “What do you want to mix
things up for?”</p>

<p>“Why he’s the fellow who did me out of my
appointment—my West Point place—he did it—Tom
Taylor!” and he pointed a wavering finger
at our hero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Well if he got the appointment it was because
he won it fair and square,” said a tall, quiet
cadet. “That’s the only way one can get into
West Point. Forget it, Hawkesbury. You’ve
had enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes, come on down to the river,” suggested
another. “A little trip on the water will do us
all good. It must be getting close to grub time,
too. Come along.”</p>

<p>Some of them linked their arms in those of
Clarence, and began to urge him out of the summer
garden. The little clash had not attracted
much attention, as it was all over so soon.</p>

<p>“I—I’ll fix him yet!” muttered Clarence, vindictively.
But he allowed himself to be led away
by his cadet friends. Perhaps the memory of that
stinging blow on his chin was a persuader.</p>

<p>“Well, you came out of that all right, Tom,”
observed Sam, when the other party, rather noisy
and hilarious, had gone away. All the while the
other cadets had followed the custom that has
prevailed from time immemorial, and did not bestow
the slightest look of recognition on the
“plebes.” But Tom and his friends were used to
that by this time, and expected it.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m sorry I had to hit him, but it was
the only way,” Tom said. “And I thought, while
I was about it, I might as well make it a good one.”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket!” Chad said. “He sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
is a cad, that Clarence fellow. What’s his game,
anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Just plain revenge and meanness, I think,”
Tom answered. “His uncle is Captain Hawkesbury,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Better not let him know you knocked his precious
nephew down, or he’ll make it hot for you,”
suggested Harry.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll probably hear of it,” said Tom, a
little apprehensively, “but I’ll be on my guard
not to get caught, just the same.”</p>

<p>They finished their cream, and then sat for a
while in the cool shade of the summer garden, enjoying
to the full the rest from drill and other
duties at the Academy.</p>

<p>It was a respite that would not occur again for
a year, perhaps longer, if any of them happened
to be caught in some scrape that would curtail
their holiday privileges.</p>

<p>And, as has been explained, they would not be
allowed a furlough until they had completed two
years at West Point. This time seemed so far
off that none of them dared think of it.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s go out around town,” suggested
Harry, after a while. “We want to take in all the
sights. Not that they’re so many, but they mean
a heap to us ‘plebes.’ Come along.”</p>

<p>“What about a moving picture show?” asked
Sam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“Have we time?” Tom asked.</p>

<p>“To see part of one, anyhow,” was the opinion
of Chad. So, having paid their score, they strolled
out. They saw nothing of Clarence or his cronies,
and a little later our friends were seated in a
small moving picture place, enjoying the reels of
comedy and tragedy.</p>

<p>They still had an hour or so of liberty left after
coming out of the exhibition before they were due
at the Academy, a special privilege having been
granted all save those being punished for some
infraction of the rules. These unfortunates were
not allowed to leave the limits of the military reservation.</p>

<p>“No need to be in a rush,” observed Chad, as
He noticed Tom heading for the place where they
had left their boat.</p>

<p>“Well, I’d rather be back a little ahead of
time than after it,” was Tom’s comment.</p>

<p>“So had I,” came from Sam.</p>

<p>“We’ve got time for an ice cream soda, anyhow,”
was Harry’s invitation to the other boys.</p>

<p>“And as it will be a long while before we’ll
have a chance at another, I move you, Mr. President,
that we take advantage of this generous offer!”
exclaimed Chad.</p>

<p>“The motion prevails,” said Tom, and they
marched to a drug store.</p>

<p>When they reached, a little later, the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
where they had left their boat, Tom and his
friends saw, just ahead of them, Clarence and the
cadets who had been with him during the unpleasantness
in the summer garden.</p>

<p>“Hold on—wait a minute,” advised Tom,
holding back. “Let’s wait until they get out of
the way.”</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid of him, are you?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p>“No, but I don’t want to get into another fight
here. One of us might go into the water, and I
don’t want it to be me,” Tom said, with a smile.</p>

<p>“That’s right. It wouldn’t look very well reporting
back all wet,” agreed Harry.</p>

<p>“They’ve got a motor boat,” remarked Sam,
as they saw Clarence and the cadets preparing to
enter a fine gasoline craft.</p>

<p>“Yes, that belongs to Captain Hawkesbury.”
Tom said. He could not keep back a certain bitter
feeling in his heart that he should be so poor
as not to be able to afford a craft of this kind,
while the other lad had one. “And, maybe, if
the truth were known,” reflected Tom, “it was
bought with the money my father might have
made on that railroad land deal.”</p>

<p>Laughing and talking loudly, the older cadets
and Clarence entered the motor craft. The engine
started with a roar, then slowed down, and
again burst into a series of explosions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked Harry, as they were getting
ready to take out their own rowboat.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re just monkeying with it,” said
Tom. “It looks as though Clarence were trying
to show how much he knows, or doesn’t know,
about a motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’d better watch his step,” observed
Harry. “The river isn’t any too smooth to-day.”</p>

<p>What with the current and wind the Hudson
was not as smooth as a millpond. But Clarence
and his chums, the cadets, seemed to have no
anxiety. They did not start off immediately from
the dock, but ran the boat up and down, Clarence
evidently letting his friends try their hands at
steering and experimenting with the engine.</p>

<p>“There they go. Now let’s start,” suggested
Tom. “They can’t run us down now, and claim
it was an accident.”</p>

<p>Slowly the rowboat made its way after the motor
launch. Tom and his chums were discussing
the experiences of the day, wondering what the
morrow would bring forth, and dwelling on the
good time they had enjoyed, when suddenly there
was a muffled report just ahead of them.</p>

<p>They all looked up, startled, and Tom cried:</p>

<p>“It’s an explosion; On that motor boat!”</p>

<p>Looking to where he pointed they saw a cloud
of smoke hovering over the craft containing Clarence
Hawkesbury and the cadets.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br><span class="small">HARD WORK</span></h2></div>


<p>“She’s on fire!” cried Sam.</p>

<p>“A goner!” echoed Harry.</p>

<p>“Steady all!” exclaimed Tom, in as calm a
tone as he could command at that critical time.
“Steady all! And give way—hard!”</p>

<p>They all knew what he meant. That they were
to row to the rescue of those in the motor boat,
where something had exploded—just what,
whether merely a carburetor, filled with gasoline,
or the main tank, could not be ascertained. Certain
it was that Clarence and those other cadets
seemed to be in great danger. They were standing
up in the bow of the craft now, as far away
from the smoke and, presumably, the flames, as
they could get, and were shouting and waving
their arms.</p>

<p>“Row hard!” ordered Tom, and he seemed,
naturally, to take command.</p>

<p>They had a six-oared barge, and Tom, as it
happened, was at the stern, in charge of the tiller
lines when the explosion occurred. He retained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
his place, and headed the craft directly for the
one now enshrouded in smoke.</p>

<p>“Row hard, boys!” he cried.</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” said Sam, in jerky tones,
as he bent his back to the oars. Each cadet had
two of the light cedar blades. They had been
rowing slowly, but they now worked up the pace
as though training for a championship.</p>

<p>The result was that the craft fairly shot
through the water, rough as it was. Tom and his
chums, in their barge, were nearer than any other
boats to the burning one.</p>

<p>“Do they see us coming?” asked Sam, whose
back, as were those of Harry and Chad, was toward
the motor boat.</p>

<p>“They seem to be too excited to notice what’s
going on,” replied Tom, as he shifted the course
a trifle. “But we’ll get there in time—I hope.”</p>

<p>He added the last words in a low tone, for,
even as he spoke, there sounded another dull and
more muffled, explosion from the motor boat, and
a larger pall of smoke rolled up.</p>

<p>“They’re going to jump,” cried Sam, who, in
the bow, gave a hasty look over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Wait!” yelled Tom, seeing the evident intention
of Clarence. He was poised on the gunwhale
of the burning boat ready to dive, but the
cadets seemed to be trying to put out the fire.</p>

<p>“We’ll be with you in a minute!” Tom added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>This time his voice carried, and that he was
heard was evident, as some of the cadets waved
their hands to him. One of them was seen to
grasp Clarence.</p>

<p>“There’s time enough yet not to jump, though
maybe it would be safer,” said Harry. “They
can all swim I guess.”</p>

<p>Swimming was an accomplishment insisted on
at West Point, as was dancing, and it was not to
be doubted that the cadets were adepts at it. As
for Clarence, Tom knew the youth was quite at
home in the water.</p>

<p>So aside from the chance that some of them
might be taken with a cramp, or weighted down
with water-soaked clothing, there was really no
particular danger in jumping overboard.</p>

<p>There was one chance, though, that in leaping
out suddenly they might capsize the motor boat,
and if water entered the cockpit, it would spread
the burning gasoline. That is the risk of bringing
water in contact with a gasoline fire. It must
never be used; sand or some proper chemical being
called for in that emergency.</p>

<p>“Give way—a little more!” Tom called. He
was not at all selfish in this. Had he been at the
oars, and one of his companions at the tiller lines,
he would have pulled with all his strength. The
proper directing of the craft and the urging of it
forward are equally important.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Way she is!” panted Sam.</p>

<p>“Watch yourselves now,” Tom cautioned them,
as they neared the burning craft. “I’m going to
put us around so the smoke will blow away from
us. We’ll take ’em all in our boat if they can’t
put out the fire.”</p>

<p>“I guess we can hold ’em,” said Chad. “We’ll
probably have to take ’em anyhow, for even if
they douse the blaze the boat will be stalled.”</p>

<p>“Steady now!” called Tom. He sent the
rowboat close to the bow of the motor craft, in
such a position that the smoke would be blown
away from the rescuing party.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” called Tom, as some
of the other cadets put out their hands to grasp
the gunwhale of the rowboat.</p>

<p>“Explosion—carburetor,” was the short answer
of one of the cadets. At last the time-honored
rule of an upper classman’s not speaking
to a cadet, outside of the Academy grounds, had
been broken. But there was good excuse for it.</p>

<p>“Hurry up! Get me aboard! I don’t want
to be burned!” cried Clarence, and brushing
aside some of the cadets he had invited to ride in
his motor boat, he fairly jumped into the rowing
craft.</p>

<p>“Easy there!” was Tom’s caution, as the
barge rocked and swayed under the impact.</p>

<p>“The cad!” murmured one of the upper classmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
under his breath, as he shot a vindictive look
at Clarence. The latter had saved himself, at
any rate. He was not a very gallant host, to say
the least.</p>

<p>“Let the boat go, fellows!” he called. “Save
yourselves!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you put out the fire?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“We used up all the chemical extinguisher
there was on board,” explained one of the cadets.
“I guess she’ll have to burn.”</p>

<p>The gasoline was burning and flickering under
and about the flooded carburetor. At any moment
it might run along the copper supply pipe,
or melt it. The tank would then explode.</p>

<p>“Guess we can’t do anything more, fellows,”
said one of the cadets, regretfully enough, for the
motor boat was a fine craft.</p>

<p>“No, get aboard,” Tom said. “If we only
had some sand we might put it out.”</p>

<p>Clarence sat huddled up in the rowboat, a picture
of varying emotions. He did not look at
Tom.</p>

<p>By this time, however, several other boats on
the river had come up, some of them being motor
craft. One was well supplied with chemical extinguishers,
and, at considerable risk, the men
aboard it began to fight the fire in Clarence’s
boat.</p>

<p>Tom, his chums, and the other cadets helped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
but Clarence himself remained as far away from
danger as he could.</p>

<p>Finally the fire was put out, without great
damage having been done, though the burned boat
was unable to run under its own power.</p>

<p>“Will you let us have the honor of putting
you ashore?” asked Tom, of the cadet who
seemed to be the leader of the little party with
Clarence, “or do you—”</p>

<p>“Thanks very much, old man. If you’ll row us
over to the Point we’ll appreciate it. It’s about
time we reported back. What do you want done
with this boat of yours, anyhow, Hawkesbury?”
he asked of Clarence, a bit sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care,” was the sullen answer.</p>

<p>“This gentleman says he’ll tow it to a repair
dock if you say so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose that will be best,” Clarence
said. He did not seem to have sense enough to
express his thanks. But the cadets did this for
him, apologizing for the condition of the youth.</p>

<p>Then, when the disabled boat was being towed
up the river, Tom and his chums rowed the upper
classmen and Clarence to the West Point shore
of the Hudson.</p>

<p>“Thanks very much, fellows,” said the older
cadets to Tom and his chums, as they disembarked.
“You did us a good turn all right, and
we shan’t forget it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>The thanks were formal, and, as soon as expressed,
the same cold and distant manner that
always marked the difference between the plebes
and the others was resumed. But Tom and his
chums understood. They had made some lasting
friends that day.</p>

<p>Clarence Hawkesbury, however, did not stop
to thank those who had saved him from possible
injury, if not death. As soon as the rowboat
touched the dock he sneaked off, too mean to utter
a decent word.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” asked one
of the upper classmen of another.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to tell you,” was the rejoinder. “This
is the last time I’ll go out with that cad!”</p>

<p>“Same here!”</p>

<p>And so the little incident passed into history.</p>

<p>Now began a period of hard work for Tom
and his chums. Following the Fourth of July
they were assigned to guard duty for the first
time. Some of the new cadets were on
duty all night, and every half-hour the call had
to be passed along, the number of the post being
given, with the words:</p>

<p>“All’s well!”</p>

<p>It was as near to war conditions as the boys
were likely to approach in some time.</p>

<p>Drills were now frequent, and were of various
kinds; company drill, with field guns, in which no
horses were used at first, mortar battery drill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
battalion drill, and so on. The boys were tired
many times during the days and nights spent in
camp, but they all realized that it was for their
good, that it was what they had come to West
Point to learn, and that it was very necessary, if
they were to become soldiers.</p>

<p>Tom sometimes wished he could take part with
the older classes in building pontoon bridges, and
in the practical military engineering, which consisted
in mounting guns temporarily, making
hasty entrenchments, temporary fortifications,
barbed-wire entanglements, and so on.</p>

<p>But this was only for the upper classmen, and
he realized that his turn would come soon enough.
As for the “plebes” they had a daily routine that
was rather dull, and often consisted in doing
work in preparation for the evolutions and practice
of the higher classes.</p>

<p>Dancing and swimming lessons were a part of
the work, and it may be guessed that on hot days
there was no inducement needed to get the boys
into the water. It was not quite so with the
dancing, however. Even though some of them
were good dancers already, it was little fun whirling
about with another plebe wearing a white
handkerchief on his arm, to indicate that he was
a “lady.”</p>

<p>But it all had to be done, and Tom rather liked
it.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br><span class="small">ON FURLOUGH</span></h2></div>


<p>Tom had frequent letters from his mother,
and in turn he sent her long accounts of his life at
West Point. He emphasized the best points
only, leaving out all references to the hard work,
unless he could give a humorous turn to it, which
he frequently did.</p>

<p>He did not mention his trouble with Clarence,
and made light of the rescue of the boys from
the burning motor boat. This was in case she
might see something of it in the papers. It was
reported in some of the New York journals, but,
as Tom afterward learned, was not printed in
his home town.</p>

<p>Indirectly Tom learned that Clarence had his
motor boat repaired and went to Florida with it.</p>

<p>“Well, that’ll take him out of the way here
for some time,” commented Sam, on hearing the
news.</p>

<p>“Yes, he isn’t a fellow I take to,” added
Harry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>Tom, too, was glad his enemy was, even temporarily,
away from West Point.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be selfish,” Tom said, “but I
hope he doesn’t come to this Academy when I’m
here.”</p>

<p>The time was approaching when camp would
be broken, and the cadets return to barracks.
Though in a measure some looked forward to
this, as welcoming any change, Tom knew it
meant harder mental work in their studies,
though he and his chums would be freed from the
labor required of them in waiting on the upper
classmen. Then, too, it would be a change, and
change of any sort was welcome at this stage of a
plebe’s life.</p>

<p>So life in camp went on as usual with the final
day approaching nearer and nearer each twenty-four
hours. The annual illumination of the
camp, which is timed for about a week before it
breaks up, was a gala event. Hundreds of Japanese
lanterns were hung about the tents, which
were otherwise decorated, and there was music of
different varieties supplied by the talented cadets.
The band played also, and there were visitors
galore.</p>

<p>Tom did not receive any company, though his
chums had sisters and girl friends and relatives
who came for the occasion. But Mrs. Taylor
wrote that she was unable to come, and Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
could guess the reason why—a lack of money.</p>

<p>“Hang it all!” he exclaimed disconsolately,
“I wish I could hurry up and get rich—quick.”</p>

<p>But few persons do that, except in stories, and
they, as the little boy said, don’t count.</p>

<p>“If I could only get hold of some of father’s
former wealth we’d be on Easy Street,” mused
Tom.</p>

<p>He thought of how Captain Hawkesbury and
Aaron Doolittle had so easily profited by his father’s
efforts, and a deep regret filled our hero’s
heart. Of course Tom realized that his father
might have mismanaged, and have made mistakes
or unfortunate speculations, as men often do.</p>

<p>“But to think they profited by it, and then to
have them treat us as they do galls me,” Tom
went on to himself. “If I could only find out
whether there was anything wrong—any deal
between Hawkesbury and Doolittle—I might be
able to get back something out of the wreck. But
I guess they’re too foxy for me.”</p>

<p>Captain Hawkesbury’s evident dislike of Tom
had not abated much. True the army captain
could not do a great deal to Tom, but what little
he could do he did, and it only takes a little additional,
during a lad’s first year at West Point,
to make him almost hate life. The only excuse
is that it is excellent training for him.</p>

<p>Every time he had a chance Captain Hawkesbury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
made matters unpleasant for Tom, giving
him extra hours of guard duty for the slightest
infraction of rules. Be Tom’s shoes never so
brilliantly polished, his rifle never so shining, and
his face never so cleanly shaved, he often was
called to account for some fancied neglect. Others,
as well, were reprimanded by different officers,
but every one noticed that more than Tom’s
just share of reproof and punishment was meted
out to him.</p>

<p>“I know what he’s doing it for, too,” Tom
told his chums. “He hopes I’ll withdraw and
make a vacancy in our district so Clarence will
have a chance. But I’m going to stick!” he declared
with a grim tightening of his lips.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” exclaimed Sam, clapping Tom
heartily on the back.</p>

<p>And so life went on, not altogether evenly, but
as happily as could be expected.</p>

<p>With the usual noise, shouting and hilarity the
class that was on furlough—the second year men—came
back with the usual ceremonies; marching
up the hill from the station, and posing for their
photograph on the chapel steps. Before this,
however, they had been pulled and hauled about,
to make their clothing and hats look more like
the apparel of tramps than anything else. But
that was part of the game.</p>

<p>Soon they had gone on to barracks, where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
donned their natty uniforms, and once again they
took up life where they had left off. Two more
years of it and they would graduate.</p>

<p>Tom looked at them longingly. Would he
ever reach that point? It seemed very far off.</p>

<p>Finally came the day for breaking camp. The
tents, the ropes of which had been previously
loosed, fell as one at the tap of the drum, and
a little later, piled in wagons, were being carted
away with the paraphernalia. Then came the
marching of the cadets back to barracks, and
Tom and Sam went to the room that had been
assigned to them, Harry and Chad being quartered
near.</p>

<p>The room of Tom and his chum was plainly,
even severely, furnished. It was as unlike the
average college student’s room as is possible to
imagine. Not a sofa cushion was allowed, nothing
but hard-bottomed chairs, and even the clock on
the mantel, where must also be kept the official
blue book of regulations, must not cost above a
certain sum. There were no decorations, no pictures—nothing
but bare, cheerless walls. It was
military, and that was the best that could be said
of it.</p>

<p>Tom and Sam had to take turns in keeping the
room in order, each being held responsible on alternate
weeks. They must do their sweeping,
their dusting and the carrying of water. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
Biblical injunction to hew wood did not apply in
their case.</p>

<p>There were two inspections to be provided for,
one in the morning and one in the evening, and
everything in the room, needless to say, must be
spick and span in anticipation of this. There was
a difference between Sunday and week-day inspections.</p>

<p>On the latter the cadets might be absent at
drill or recitations when their rooms were looked
at. In this case they did not see the inspector.
But if they happened to be in when he made his
round they could be in fatigue uniform, or if the
inspection did not take place until after eleven
o’clock in the morning, it was permitted to wear
a dressing gown.</p>

<p>But the Sunday inspections are the critical ones.
The cadets have to be in their rooms then, attired
in their best dress coats and gloves without
a speck. The slightest article out of place, or
the least deviation from the regulations, causes
the tactical officer to make an adverse report or
“skin.” The cadet captain is also present at
these Sunday inspections.</p>

<p>There was a slight change in the routine after
the return to barracks. Recitations began early
in September, and the time of rising was put back
a half hour, being at six o’clock. Breakfast was a
half hour later, guard mounting at seven-ten and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
recitations, after the call to quarters, began at eight
o’clock.</p>

<p>There were four recitation periods up to nearly
one o’clock and the classes were so divided that
while one section recited another studied.</p>

<p>Tom found it rather strange at first, to be under
absolutely no set rules or requirements in regard
to study. The cadets were allowed to fix
their own standards in this respect. All that was
required of them was that they be perfect in recitation.</p>

<p>Military discipline, of course, was insisted on.
The instructors were all West Point graduates,
the strictest of the strict, and not only must the
cadets be perfect in their lessons, but in their
manner, deportment and dress. Woe betide he
whose shoes were not polished to just the proper
degree of brilliancy, or who came in with a speck
on his otherwise immaculate collar.</p>

<p>But Tom and his chums managed to worry
through, somehow or other. They were not the
most brilliant students, neither were they the lowest.
In fact, they were a good average, and they
were fairly well satisfied with themselves.</p>

<p>The work was hard—no one denied that. On
the other hand the results were in keeping. It
was worth all it cost—Tom felt sure of that.</p>

<p>Now and then the boys would be caught in
some infraction of the rules—such as having a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
light in their rooms at forbidden hours, even
though they carefully darkened the windows.
They were given extra tours of duty on Saturday
afternoons for such things, when otherwise they
might have been free to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>In January would come the examinations for
those who failed to qualify in class to a certain
percentage. Tom and Chad were among the
lucky ones who escaped the nerve-racking ordeal
of a strict examination before the official board,
but Sam and Harry were obliged to submit. However,
they were successful, and breathed easier.</p>

<p>Some of the plebes were dropped, not coming
up to the standard in the January tests, and were
obliged to withdraw, giving their friends and
relatives whatever excuse they thought best suited
to the occasion.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re here yet!” exclaimed Tom to his
chums when it was all over.</p>

<p>“All here, what there is left of us?” sighed
Sam, who had come pretty close to failure in one
study.</p>

<p>The examination days brought with them some
spare time which the cadets enjoyed in outdoor
sports.</p>

<p>And so, in the way already described, Tom
passed two years at West Point. He had not seen
his mother in all that time, though he heard from
her often. You may judge, then, of his delight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
when, having successfully passed his second year,
he was allowed a furlough of two months to go
back home.</p>

<p>“And I want to see you very much, Tom,”
Mrs. Taylor wrote. “I have something important
to tell you.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what it can be?” Tom mused, as
he prepared to leave the Academy for a short
time.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br><span class="small">A QUARREL</span></h2></div>


<p>“Oh, Tom! How fine you look! How tall and
straight you are! What a—why, what a <i>man</i> you
have become!”</p>

<p>Thus our hero’s mother greeted him as she met
him at the Chester station on the occasion of
Tom’s first home-coming.</p>

<p>“Tom, you are so—so big!”</p>

<p>Her eyes were shining, as only a mother’s eyes
can shine, while she held out her hands to welcome
her son.</p>

<p>“Well, Mother,” Tom said, as he kissed her,
“West Point makes a specialty of helping boys
grow up. I hope they didn’t make any mistake
in my case.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure they didn’t!” she said. “You certainly
are taller and straighter.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity if I shouldn’t be, mother, with all
the bracing-back I’ve been doing in the last two
years. For a time I thought I wouldn’t have
anything but shoulders, but I’m getting used to
it now. How are you, and what’s the news?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“As if I could tell you all the news of two
years in a moment!” she objected.</p>

<p>“Well, tell me about yourself. Are you getting
along all right?”</p>

<p>As he asked this question Tom looked searchingly
at his mother. He saw that she was thinner
than she had been when he went away, and
she looked paler—as though she had spent many
long and weary hours bending over her sewing.
And, had Tom but known it, this was the fact.</p>

<p>In a way he bitterly reproached himself for
having gone to West Point, leaving her to fight
the battle of life alone, and when he hinted at
this, and frankly offered to resign and seek some
employment that would bring in a large immediate
return, she said:</p>

<p>“No, Tom. You must keep on as you have
started. This is to be your life-work. You will
have only one chance, and you must take advantage
of it. We can stand a little privation now
for the sake of what will come afterward.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want you to stand privation,
Mother. It isn’t fair that I should have it easy
while you work so hard.”</p>

<p>“Are you having it easy, Tom?”</p>

<p>She looked at him closely as she asked this.</p>

<p>“Well, the fellows don’t call it easy,” he admitted.</p>

<p>“I understand,” she said smiling. “Now don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
worry about me. I am making enough to live on.
You are paying your own way, and a little more,
though I wish I could send you some money occasionally.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t use it!” he said, with a laugh. “I
haven’t exhausted my Academy credit yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t be very much longer,” she went
on with a sigh. “The next two years will go past
quickly, and then——”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take care of you, Mother!” Tom
exclaimed. “Once I graduate, I’ll be earning
enough to make life easier for you. There won’t
be a needle or a spool of thread in the house.”</p>

<p>“What about mending for you?” she asked,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m a pretty fair sewer myself,” he
laughed. “But, Mother,” he asked, as they were
on their way to the little cottage, “what was it
you mentioned in your letter, about something
important to tell me?”</p>

<p>Tom looked searchingly at his mother as they
walked up the main street of the town. Nothing
had changed much, Tom thought, during his two
years’ absence. Here and there a new front had
been put on to some store, and there were two new
moving picture places. But otherwise Chester
was about the same.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mother?” Tom asked again, as
he noted that she hesitated about answering. “Is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
it the old problem—money—father’s affairs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom, in a way. You know how the valuable
land, now used as an approach to the railroad
bridge, passed away from us. I have always
thought that there was something wrong about
that. I had an idea that it was, in some way,
secured against anything that could happen.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by ‘secured’?”</p>

<p>“I mean I understood your father to say, shortly
before he died so suddenly, that if anything
happened to him, that land would yield enough
of an income for you and me to live on until you
were old enough to look after yourself, and me,
too. He always had an idea that it would be very
valuable, though whether or not he had an intimation
that the railroad was coming through I
can not say.”</p>

<p>“You say he told you the land was secured?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“That was the word he used—yes.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say how, did he?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but I understood he had put it
in trust—deeded it, in some way, so that it would
eventually come to us—to you and to me.”</p>

<p>“Did he ever show you any papers in that connection?”</p>

<p>“No. He was going to, and we had planned
to go over the matter together, when he fell ill,
and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>Her voice choked, and she could not proceed
for a moment.</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes filled with tears as he led his
mother into the house. They sat down together,
and presently Mrs. Taylor regained control of
herself, so that she could go on.</p>

<p>“Why I said anything in my letter,” she resumed,
“was because of something I found when
going over some old papers of your father’s. It
was a few days ago, and among some useless
documents I found a rough draft of a trust deed
he had drawn up regarding the railroad property,
as I call it.”</p>

<p>“To whom was the deed made out?” Tom
asked.</p>

<p>“To Captain Hawkesbury and Mr. Doolittle.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried Tom, startled by his mother’s
answer. “To those—”</p>

<p>“Now don’t be rash, son,” she advised him.
“The land was not actually deeded to these two
men. It was only to go to them in trust for you
and me. Your father’s idea was, as I understand
it, that Captain Hawkesbury and Mr. Doolittle
could make a better bargain with the railroad
people than we could. So he made this deed in
trust.”</p>

<p>“And is this how those two—those two men—”
Tom controlled his words by an effort—“is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
this how they got the property away from
us—through that deed of trust?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Tom,” said Mrs. Taylor simply.
“All I have to go by is the rough draft of
the deed of trust. Whether your father carried
out his idea as outlined in that, I cannot say. The
plan was probably a good one, but it failed as far
as we are concerned. I mean we have derived
no benefit from the land.”</p>

<p>“No, but we will, Mother!” Tom exclaimed,
vigorously.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Mrs. Taylor was
startled.</p>

<p>“I mean I am going to see Mr. Doolittle, and
ask him about this deed of trust. If he and Captain
Hawkesbury held the land in that way they
should turn over to us the money they got from
the railroad company. It must be a large sum.
Why, it’s just as if they were the guardians of
the land for our benefit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom, that is if your father carried out
his idea. But I have no means of knowing
whether he did or not. I have searched all
through his papers, but I found nothing more on
the subject. I don’t see what we can do, but I
thought I had better tell you of it.”</p>

<p>“I am very glad you did, Mother,” Tom said,
quietly.</p>

<p>“I only discovered the draft a few days before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
I wrote to you,” Tom’s mother said. “But it
all seems so useless.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t!” he exclaimed, earnestly. “I’m
going to do something.”</p>

<p>“Nothing rash, Tom, I hope!” she said, apprehensively.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly that. But I’m going to see
Mr. Doolittle, and ask him a thing or two.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor was surprised at the change in
her son. He was very much more of a man than
when he left two years before. He seemed very
capable.</p>

<p>This, of course, was due to the West Point
training. It tends to make a lad stand on his own
feet, for the Academy trains him with the idea of
some day having him handle large bodies of men;
and to rule over others one must first learn to
govern himself.</p>

<p>“Let me see that paper, Mother,” Tom said,
when they had talked the matter over a little
longer.</p>

<p>She gave it to him, and he studied it earnestly.
It was, as she had said, a copy, or draft, of a
deed of trust, for the valuable land on which one
end of the railroad bridge stood.</p>

<p>“I’ll see Doolittle about this,” Tom decided.</p>

<p>However, he did not carry out his intention
that day. He was tired with his trip, and he
wanted to be in the best condition when he met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the man who he had reason to suspect was a
clever schemer, if not a downright swindler.</p>

<p>Tom spent some time in going about town,
renewing acquaintance with his former school
chums. He had much to tell them of his life at
West Point, and he, in turn, listened to much of
interest.</p>

<p>Then, having ascertained from a local lawyer
a general idea of how deeds of trust were executed
and carried out, Tom called on Mr. Doolittle.</p>

<p>Aaron Doolittle was a local character. In a
way he was a sort of Shylock, but he would not
have felt complimented had any one called him
that, though his knowledge of Shakespeare was
limited. Mr. Doolittle had money, and he loaned
it out on the best of security at high rates of interest.</p>

<p>Tom found him in his office over the local
bank, in which, it was rumored, Mr. Doolittle
held a large interest.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” fairly snarled the
financier of Tom, as the latter entered. “I
haven’t any money to lend, if that’s what you’ve
come for.”</p>

<p>“Money to lend?” repeated Tom, somewhat
surprised.</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s what I said! If you came here
thinking to get enough to keep on with that silly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
soldier life you’ve been leading you can march
right out again, the way you came in. You’ll
get no money from me!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not so sure of that,” Tom said,
more coolly than he felt.</p>

<p>“Hey? What do you mean?” Mr. Doolittle
seemed alarmed.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you that later,” Tom said significantly,
as he felt in his pocket to see if he had the draft
of the deed safe. “But just now I’ll say I didn’t
come to borrow any money.” Tom emphasized
the word “borrow.”</p>

<p>“Another thing,” he went on. “I don’t need
money to continue at West Point. I am being paid
for staying there.”</p>

<p>“Paid! Huh! What’s this country coming
to, anyhow, when it squanders money on such foolishness?”
snorted the crabbed old man.</p>

<p>Tom did not answer that question. It was too
big. What he did say was:</p>

<p>“Mr. Doolittle, I have called on you in reference
to a deed of trust my father drew shortly
before his death, naming you and Captain
Hawkesbury as trustees of a certain piece of
land—land where the railroad bridge now stands.
That land has been sold, and I think the money
for it should come to my mother and to me. I
have here—”</p>

<p>That was as far as Tom got just then. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
Doolittle fairly leaped from his chair, his face
blazing with wrath.</p>

<p>“You—you—” he stammered out. Words
failed him for a moment.</p>

<p>“Get out of my office!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Not until you have answered my question,”
said Tom, coolly.</p>

<p>“How dare you ask me any questions?”</p>

<p>“How dare I? Why, I think I have a very
good right, since you were in charge of some of
my father’s property.”</p>

<p>“Your father’s property! He left none! All
he did own was swallowed up in debts. He owes
me money now, if the truth were known.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that,” Tom said, quietly.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe it? Well, I’ll prove it to
you!” fairly shouted the angry man. “That
deed of trust! Bah! There never was any! He
deeded that property outright to Captain
Hawkesbury and me for what he owed us, and it
wasn’t enough. Now you get out of my office! I
won’t be insulted by you!”</p>

<p>Tom thought he was the one being insulted, and
his looks showed it.</p>

<p>“Now listen to me——” he began, as calmly
as he could.</p>

<p>“I won’t listen,” interrupted the angry man.
“I want you to understand that—but what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
is the use of talking to such a boy as you.
I—I——”</p>

<p>“I think you had better listen, Mr. Doolittle.
I want to——”</p>

<p>“Get out!” stormed Mr. Doolittle. “Don’t
let me hear another word from you! As for that
deed of trust—”</p>

<p>He made a grab for the paper Tom held, but
our hero stepped back, a surprised look on his
face.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br><span class="small">BACK AT WEST POINT</span></h2></div>


<p>“Just a moment, Mr. Doolittle,” said our
hero, coolly. “Did you want to look at this
paper?” and he held the deed of trust, or, rather,
the rough draft of it, up so the crabbed old money
lender could fix his eyes on it.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to look at it,” was the snarling
answer.</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me. I thought you did,” Tom
went on. He realized that he had just saved the
document from possible destruction, for the old
man had certainly made a grab for the paper, and,
had he secured it he might have held it to a burning
gas-jet near his desk, where he had been
melting some sealing wax when Tom came in.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to see it,” Mr. Doolittle
went on. “It isn’t any good. Your father may
have had an idea of putting that land in trust,
but he didn’t do it, and you can’t prove that he
did.”</p>

<p>This, Tom realized, was his weak point. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
had absolutely no proof that the land was only
deeded in trust to Captain Hawkesbury and Mr.
Doolittle. That it was actually deeded to them
was brought out at Mr. Taylor’s death, for the
deed had been put on record, and they had
claimed the land and sold it to the railroad company.
They claimed that Mr. Taylor had given
them the land in payment for money they had
advanced to him.</p>

<p>“That paper isn’t any good,” went on the old
money-lender. “It might just as well be thrown
away. It has no value.”</p>

<p>It was strange then, Tom thought, that Mr.
Doolittle should make such an effort to secure it.
But he said nothing about that then. Mr. Doolittle
appeared to have another sudden wave of
anger.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any time to waste with you!” he
stormed. “You needn’t come here bothering me.
Now you get out and don’t let me see any more
of you. If you think that paper’s any good why
don’t you take it to some lawyer? There’s plenty
of ’em trying to make a living at law,” and he
chuckled mirthlessly.</p>

<p>Tom folded the document and put it back in
his pocket. He realized that it would be of no
use to show the paper to a lawyer. What would
be the effect of an unexecuted deed of trust that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
was not even signed? Tom knew the only thing
that would avail him would be the completed
document itself, and that would have no effect
unless it was dated after the deed that had been
put on file—that deed which gave the property to
the two men who had sold it.</p>

<p>Much disappointed, Tom went out. He had
tried and failed. Well, matters could go on as
they were. There was still West Point, and Tom
had yet to make an assault on the final heights on
top of which lay the coveted diploma. Once he
had secured that, he would see what could be
done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor did not show much disappointment,
however much she may have felt, and there
must have been some.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Tom,” she said, when he reported
to her the result of his call on Mr. Doolittle.
“You tried, and that was the best thing
to do. We aren’t any worse off than we were.
We’ll get along somehow,” she said bravely.</p>

<p>“Yes, but, Mother, I can’t bear to have you
work so hard!”</p>

<p>“Work is the greatest blessing in this world,
Tom,” she said with one of her fine smiles. She
did not add that it helped her to forget her great
loss. But perhaps Tom understood.</p>

<p>Putting aside the memory of the unpleasant interview<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
with Mr. Doolittle, Tom tried to enjoy
his furlough. He went out with many of his former
friends, and made some new ones. He was
in great demand at several little dances gotten up
by the High School Alumnae, and he showed
some of the girls new steps that he had learned
from his cadet chums.</p>

<p>“Say, Tom,” remarked Walter Penfield, one
day, “I’ll be glad when you go back to the Academy.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Tom, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Because the girls talk about nothing but you
and your dances. You don’t give another fellow
a show!”</p>

<p>“Oh, if that’s all,” said Tom, “come in and
I’ll teach you a few new wrinkles.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Walter. “You may stay as
long as you like.”</p>

<p>But Tom’s time was strictly limited and he had
to return to West Point the last of August. As
was the custom, he and his chums marched up the
hill, torn and disheveled as to hats and garments,
and had their photographs taken. Then they took
up the life where they had left off, some two
months before.</p>

<p>Tom had been made a cadet officer, and that,
with the advance in class, gave him more privileges
than he had had formerly. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
harder work to do, of course, for the studies were
advanced. He had lessons in astronomy, and
had to spend long night hours in the observatory
taking observations of the stars. He became a
fine mathematician, and he fairly dreamed figures.</p>

<p>Building pontoon bridges, working with big
guns and mortars, planning entrenchments, taking
part in sham battles, riding in the seemingly
reckless manner that characterizes West Pointers—these
largely made up Tom’s life in the
second stage of his stay at the Military Academy.</p>

<p>Tom had rather hoped that Captain Hawkesbury
would not be at West Point after the furlough,
but this was a vain wish, for the old army
captain, grimmer and meaner than before, if that
were possible, was “right on the job,” as Sam
expressed it.</p>

<p>Of course, Tom again fell easily into the life
with his former chums, and he made some new
acquaintances that were pleasant. But overshadowing
everything was a suspicion, deep back
in Tom’s brain, that all was not right in regard
to the railroad land. That deed of trust could
not be forgotten, though how he was to turn it
to advantage Tom could not figure out.</p>

<p>He knew it would be worse than useless to appeal
to Captain Hawkesbury. That official cordially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
disliked him, Tom was sure, and he did not
want to have a scene at West Point. So he said
nothing, but he resolved to keep his eyes open.</p>

<p>Of Clarence Hawkesbury, Tom saw little. If
the rich youth made another effort to enter West
Point, Tom was not aware of it. He did see
Clarence once or twice, the latter coming to some
affairs given by the upper classmen. But Clarence
took no notice of Tom.</p>

<p>Not that this worried our hero any. He was
only too glad not to come in contact with the
bully, for he wanted no more scenes like the one
that had preceded the motor boat accident.</p>

<p>Tom wished he had a chance to ascertain what
went on between Captain Hawkesbury and Mr.
Doolittle. He wondered if the two corresponded,
and whether the old army officer had been
informed of Tom’s visit to the money-lender.
But of course there was no way of finding this
out. Tom could not play the spy in that fashion,
and he seldom had a chance, now, to visit the
captain’s quarters.</p>

<p>Occasionally he was sent there, in the course
of his duties, or to receive some reprimand for a
real or fancied breach of the rules. But Captain
Hawkesbury left no more papers or letters lying
about. Perhaps he was aware that Tom was
eager to get some sort of evidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>Among the pleasures now allowed Tom and
his chums since they had graduated into a higher
class was that of riding out on the public roads
on Wednesdays and Saturdays. They had all
become expert horsemen, and took delight in their
steeds.</p>

<p>The pleasures of riding by themselves on the
public road were rather limited by the injunction
that no one must dismount unless it was necessary,
and they could not go off the main roads.
But, of course, the construction placed on the
word “necessary” in regard to dismounting, was
capable of extended application. Tom and his
chums managed to have good times.</p>

<p>Occasionally they met Captain Hawkesbury
on these rides. He only saluted them stiffly, and
passed on, hardly giving Tom a glance.</p>

<p>“I suppose he thinks Clarence ought to be in
my place,” Tom said to Sam.</p>

<p>“Let him take it out in supposing then,” was
the rejoinder. “That can’t hurt you.”</p>

<p>“No, but if he thinks we get off the horses now
and then for—well, say a little rest, he’d be the
first one to report it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Harry. “Say, we’ll have
to watch him. And if we ever think he’s on to
our game we’ll get ahead of him by reporting
ourselves first.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” agreed Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>There was a book kept in the guardhouse and
in this volume the cadets who were allowed the
riding privileges were required to register their
departure and arrival. If the cadets chose they
could also note, or report, any of their own infractions
of the rules against dismounting without
sufficient cause.</p>

<p>“Letter for you, Tom,” announced Sam one
day, as his chum came in. “From home, I guess,”
for Tom had told his chums the name of his home
town, and it was plainly to be observed in the
postmark.</p>

<p>“That’s good!” Tom said, as he took the
envelope. “Yes, it’s from mother,” he added, as
he recognized the dear, familiar handwriting—a
handwriting cramped of late, Tom thought, by
too much sewing.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I’ll ever be able to help her, and
relieve her of that hateful work,” he thought, as
he tore the covering off the epistle. “It sure is
a long time to wait—two years more, and then
four more before I’ll really be earning anything
worth while. Oh, why can’t I get hold of that
railroad land?”</p>

<p>Tom’s self-asked question was accented in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
mind a moment later by what he read in his
mother’s letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I wonder if it is possible, Tom, for you to
send me a little money? I know you spoke of
being paid a salary, and that it was held to accumulate
for you. You said you would not need
it all, and as I am a little pressed for cash just
now, and as the sewing is falling off a little, I
thought perhaps the authorities would give you
some of what is rightfully yours.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Great Scott!” cried Tom, aloud, before he
thought of what he was saying.</p>

<p>“No bad news, I hope, old man! is there?”
asked Sam.</p>

<p>“No—er—that is not exactly—no,” Tom
stammered. “It’s just a little matter. I dare
say it will be all right.”</p>

<p>Though he tried to speak calmly, Tom’s mind
was in a tumult. He hardly knew what to do,
and for a moment he was tempted to lay the whole
matter before Sam; but a natural delicacy stopped
him.</p>

<p>Sam was wealthy, Tom knew, and he felt that
as soon as money was mentioned his chum would
offer to get him as much as was needed.</p>

<p>“I’ll try to get what is my own first,” Tom decided.
“It isn’t much, but it will help mother out.
Hang it all! Why can’t I earn money? Or why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
can’t I get what I believe is rightfully ours. I’m
going to do something!”</p>

<p>Just what he was going to do Tom did not
know. He could not decide so suddenly. Slowly
he folded the letter from his mother, and placed
it in his pocket. Sam watched his chum, covertly,
and wished he could aid him.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty sure that was bad news Tom got,”
reflected Sam, when his chum had gone out. “And
it must have been about money, for if it was a
death, or anything like that, he’d have been willing
enough to tell. I wish he would tell me. I’d
lend him all he needs. But he’s too proud to ask,
and I can’t offer, for that might hurt his feelings.
Well, I’ll wait a bit and see what turns up.”</p>

<p>Matters were rapidly shaping themselves for
the upturn, but neither Tom nor Sam knew this.</p>

<p>Our hero walked out to think alone for a time.
He wondered if the plan his mother suggested
were feasible. He resolved to find out, and began
making some judicious inquiries.</p>

<p>The answers Tom received told him that it
would be better not to ask for this money just at
present for certain reasons that need not be
detailed.</p>

<p>“One thing I am going to do though, is to
tackle old Hawkesbury!” Tom decided. “It’s
time I did, and I wish I had done so as soon as I
came back with that copy of the trust deed. Doolittle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
must have written and told him what I said,
and maybe the captain is wondering why I haven’t
been to him before. Probably he’s all primed
and ready for me, and will unlimber with all his
guns, but I can’t help that. I’ve got to do something
for my mother. I can’t have her suffer!”</p>

<p>Tom had a bitter feeling in his heart against
the old army officer, but he endeavored to keep
it down, and remain cool as he planned the interview.</p>

<p>He saw Captain Hawkesbury that afternoon,
having received permission from his immediate
superior to make the visit.</p>

<p>“Come in!” called the captain sharply as Tom
knocked.</p>

<p>Tom entered, trying to calm the rapid beating
of his heart. Buttoned under his closely-fitting
coat was the rough draft of the trust deed. Tom
expected to use it.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want?” was the not very
pleasant greeting of Captain Hawkesbury.</p>

<p>“A few moments’ conversation with you, sir,”
Tom answered. The captain did not ask him to
sit down, but remained seated at his own desk,
looking at Tom with sharp eyes, in which our
hero fancied he could detect a gleam of hate.</p>

<p>“I haven’t much time,” said the military man.
“Is it something in regard to your duties here?”</p>

<p>“No, it is something personal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>“I have nothing to do with you, personally!”
was the frigid answer.</p>

<p>“There was a time when you were glad to
have something to do with us,” went on Tom,
boldly. “When father—”</p>

<p>“That’s enough!” exclaimed Captain Hawkesbury
sharply. “You need not bring up the past.
I was very much disappointed in your father. He
made a failure, and I and some of his friends were
hard put to make matters come out right for the
estate.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that!” cried Tom, stung by
the cruel words.</p>

<p>“What! Do you mean to tell me that I am
not speaking the truth?” Captain Hawkesbury
almost leaped from his chair.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean anything of the sort,” went on
Tom, resolved to stake everything now. “I
think you and Mr. Doolittle were mistaken about
my father, and that there is a misunderstanding
somewhere. Perhaps this will help to clear it up,”
and Tom suddenly produced the draft of the
deed. Caution for the moment left him, and he
tossed the document on the desk in front of the
angry captain.</p>

<p>“Eh! What’s this? What’s this?” exclaimed
the officer, putting on his glasses and taking up
the paper. “What is this to me?”</p>

<p>“It is a copy of a deed of trust, drawn by my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
father, naming you and Mr. Doolittle as trustees
of the property that was bought by the railroad
for their bridge approach,” Tom said, speaking
rapidly. “It is only a copy, of course, and was
never executed. What I want to know is whether
any such paper was ever legally drawn up, and
whether or not my mother and I can get any
money from that land. We need it—she needs
it—very much.”</p>

<p>Tom was pleading now. He had put his pride
behind him.</p>

<p>“Certainly not! Certainly not!” cried Captain
Hawkesbury, fairly spluttering. “How dare
you come to me with such a question? That land
Mr. Doolittle and I took for some of the money
your father owed us. It barely sufficed. There
was not a dollar left. Something for you? Indeed
not! If I had what was right you would be
paying me now. But I will let that pass. I am
surprised at your impudence in coming to me with
such a suggestion.</p>

<p>“This document is worthless—utterly worthless.
I never saw it before, and certainly there is
none like it on file. It is of no value!”</p>

<p>Saying which Captain Hawkesbury tore the
copy of the trust deed into several pieces, and
threw them into the waste-paper basket.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Tom. “That paper is mine!”</p>

<p>He sprang forward, but was too late.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“What, would you raise your hand to me?”
fairly shouted the captain. “This is insubordination,
sir! I could order you under arrest for
that!”</p>

<p>Tom drew back. He could not afford to have
his career at West Point spoiled.</p>

<p>“But that paper! It was mine. You had no
right to destroy it!” he said.</p>

<p>“How dare you speak to me like that?” exclaimed
the old army officer with a frown.
“Leave my room this instant. I destroyed that
paper because it had my name on it and I will not
have you going around showing it to every one
and repeating a silly, baseless story. I had a
right to destroy it as one of the men involved in
your father’s affairs. Now go!”</p>

<p>He pointed to the door.</p>

<p>Tom hesitated. He might create a scene, raise
a disturbance and carry the matter to the superintendent.
Tom did not think the part Captain
Hawkesbury had played in his father’s estate
gave him a right to thus summarily destroy any
document he pleased.</p>

<p>But Tom reflected quickly. Captain Hawkesbury,
who had a certain power, might make matters
appear so that Tom would seem to be in
the wrong. Tom might even be dismissed. He
could not afford to suffer that.</p>

<p>“And, after all,” Tom reflected, “the paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
isn’t of any value. It isn’t as if it were the real
deed. I guess I’d better let the matter drop. But
he is an insufferable cad! I—I’d like to—fight
him!”</p>

<p>Tom felt a wild rage in his heart, which was
natural enough under the circumstances. He
swallowed a lump in his throat, looked unfalteringly
into the eyes of the old army officer, and,
saluting stiffly, turned and went out.</p>

<p>Tom fancied Captain Hawkesbury breathed a
sigh of relief. Was it fancy?</p>

<p>Tom had staked his little all, and he had, apparently,
lost. What would be the next move?</p>

<p>Tom’s immediate need was to get money for
his mother, and this problem was unexpectedly
solved for him. His chum, Sam, had guessed
right, and, making bold, urged Tom to tell the
truth.</p>

<p>“Look here old man,” he said, bruskly but very
kindly, “won’t you let me help you out? I think
I’ve guessed.”</p>

<p>Then Tom told the story, with the result that
Sam’s father advanced enough on some rather
poor securities Tom’s mother held to enable the
widow to make ends meet. The securities could
not be negotiated save by some one in Mr. Leland’s
line of business, but he said he was really
running no financial risk. So that matter was
settled for the time being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>As to the trust deed, Tom had given up hope
about that.</p>

<p>The work at West Point went on, Tom progressing
rapidly. He enjoyed, most of all, the
horsemanship, at which he was among the most
expert. That being so, it was difficult to account
for what occurred one day.</p>

<p>The battalion to which Tom was attached was
engaged in a sham battle, and there was some wild
riding. Tom held his own, however, until toward
the close. He was riding alone when suddenly
Captain Hawkesbury, on a mettlesome
steed, dashed out from the line of officers. At
first it seemed as though he had come out to speak
to Tom, and the latter drew rein.</p>

<p>“Go on! Go on!” shouted the captain.
“Don’t stop in my way!”</p>

<p>Tom was confused. His horse became a little
unmanageable, and as Captain Hawkesbury came
on at top speed there was a collision between
them. Tom was unhorsed and fell heavily. He
felt a sharp pain in his head, his eyes saw nothing
but blackness, and then he lay unconscious, dimly
hearing, as the fast sound, the gallop of horses’
hoofs as his companions rode toward him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br><span class="small">IN THE HOSPITAL</span></h2></div>


<p>Tom seemed to himself to come back from
some remote place with a wrench that shook his
whole body. As he said afterward it was like
falling through some vast space, bringing up with
a jerk. He seemed to be floating in space one
minute, and the next he awoke with a start to find
himself in bed. A glance around told him it was
the hospital attached to the Academy. And, thus
recognizing it, Tom was spared the necessity of
asking:</p>

<p>“Where am I?”</p>

<p>What he did ask when he saw an orderly coming
toward him was:</p>

<p>“What happened? Am I badly hurt?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much to speak of, unless something
develops internally later, so the doctor says.
You’re to keep quiet, Mr. Taylor,” the man went
on. “The doctor will be here pretty soon. He
left word he was to be called as soon as you became
conscious.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m conscious all right,” Tom said,
trying to smile. His head had been aching badly,
but the pain had somewhat stopped now. Gingerly
he moved an arm, a leg, one of his hands
and then the other. All his limbs seemed to be
still attached to him, but he was sore and stiff,
and ached in every joint and muscle.</p>

<p>“Well, how goes it, Mr. Taylor?” asked the
doctor, as he came and stood smiling beside Tom’s
bed.</p>

<p>“Pretty well, doctor.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. We’ll have you around again
soon.”</p>

<p>“Just what happened?” asked Tom. He had
a memory of Captain Hawkesbury’s horse crashing
into him, and Tom thought he himself had
been in danger of being crushed under the animal.
But evidently that had not happened.</p>

<p>“There was a collision between you and Captain
Hawkesbury,” went on the physician. “Both
your mounts seemed to get a little beyond you,
and that was strange, for the captain boasts of
being able to manage any kind of horse.</p>

<p>“That isn’t saying you mismanaged yours,
though,” the medical man went on. “I was
looking at the drill, and I want to say you got out
of what looked as if it was going to be a bad accident—you
got out of it very nicely. You had a
hard fall, and received a glancing blow on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
head from one of the horse’s feet. But aside from
the shock and the bruises you’re all right and I
think you’ll be out in about a week.”</p>

<p>“A week!” gasped Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, that isn’t long. And most of you gentlemen
would accept a week here very gladly.”</p>

<p>Tom smiled.</p>

<p>He realized that being in the hospital relieved
him from the dull routine—that he need not jump
up at reveille and could take it easy in many ways.</p>

<p>Still, though there were certain advantages
about being in the hospital while in no great danger,
there were disadvantages in Tom’s case. He
wanted to be actively doing something to help
his mother, or at least to continue an investigation
into the matter of the trust deed. He had
been thinking hard on that subject and, only that
day he had come to a new conclusion in the matter.
He had decided to appeal to a well-known
lawyer, the father of one of his cadet friends.
Tom had made up his mind to lay the whole matter
before Mr. Blasdell, state that he was unable
to pay a fee, but offering, in case any money could
be recovered from the captain and Mr. Doolittle,
to share it with the attorney. Tom felt sure Mr.
Blasdell would take the case on that basis, as
young Blasdell, who was in Tom’s class, said his
father’s firm often did that.</p>

<p>“But here I am, on my back, and unable to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
anything,” thought Tom, bitterly. “It’s just my
luck!”</p>

<p>But, while he did not know it, luck was, even
then, preparing a big and pleasant surprise for
Tom Taylor.</p>

<p>“Now you must take it easy and not fret,”
went on the doctor. “You were very fortunate
to get out of it as you did, very fortunate. I expected
to find a couple of broken bones at least,
but you young chaps have a happy faculty of falling
easy. Feel sleepy?”</p>

<p>“A little,” Tom admitted.</p>

<p>“I thought you would. Well, go to sleep.
Ring if you want anything. Rest will do you
more good than medicine.”</p>

<p>Tom closed his eyes and tried to think. The
scene of the accident was coming more clearly to
him now. He could see the captain riding toward
him—he could hear the shouts—the pounding of
the horses’ hoofs—then he opened his eyes with
a start. It was as though he felt the shock of the
collision over again.</p>

<p>“Guess I must be getting a case of nerves,”
Tom said to himself, grimly. “That won’t do!”</p>

<p>He tried to turn in bed, but such pains shot
through his whole frame that he gave it up, and
lay as he was. Finally, due either to the reaction,
or to some opiate the doctor had given him, he fell
into a heavy slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Tom felt much better when he awakened. The
orderly was near him, and asked:</p>

<p>“Do you want anything, Mr. Taylor?”</p>

<p>“Something cool to drink?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The doctor said you might have a
bit of iced lemonade, and some fruit—oranges,
perhaps?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take lemonade. It’s night, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Lights have just been turned on; yes, sir.
Some of your friends were in to see you, but the
doctor thought it best not to awaken you.”</p>

<p>“Who were they?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Leland, Mr. Houston and Mr. Wilson,”
the orderly replied, consulting a list he had evidently
prepared.</p>

<p>Tom wondered whether Captain Hawkesbury
would call and inquire after him, but he did not
like to ask. After all, he did not much care.
There was no love lost between them, and there
was no use in pretending. Still, in all decency
the captain might have called.</p>

<p>Tom was not as well next day as he had hoped
to be, nor did he progress as the doctor evidently
expected. The medical man frowned a little,
thinking perhaps his patient did not see this sign.
But if Tom saw he did not much care. He was
too ill.</p>

<p>For the next two days Tom was on the border
line between progressing favorably and going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
back. Then came the turn in his favor. Tom’s
fever left him and he was cool, though weak. He
began to take an interest in matters, and was allowed
to see his chums who called on him. They
had called every day, of course, but up to this
time, they had not been admitted to the sickroom.</p>

<p>As for Captain Hawkesbury, he probably
learned of Tom’s condition, but it was not because
he inquired.</p>

<p>“It’s a mean thing to think, much less to say,”
mused Tom, as he lay in bed staring up at the
ceiling, “but it looks to me as though Captain
Hawkesbury is glad I’m laid up. And I think
he’d be glad if I was so knocked out that I’d have
to withdraw from the Academy. Yes, I’ll go
farther and say I think he deliberately rode into
me so I would get disabled. I don’t claim he
actually wanted to injure me seriously, but he may
have thought a little knocking about would take
the starch out of me, and cause me to resign. But
I’ll not!”</p>

<p>Tom looked out of the window musingly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to stick!” he told himself, firmly,
“and I’m going after Captain Hawkesbury and
Mr. Doolittle harder than ever. That’s what
I’m going to do!”</p>

<p>Tom clenched his fists under the bedclothes—that
is he tried to, but gave it up with a wince of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
pain, for one of his arms had been badly
wrenched.</p>

<p>“Well, how are you feeling, old man?” asked
Sam, a little later, as he came in to see his chum.</p>

<p>“Oh, so-so.”</p>

<p>“That’s good. We all miss you.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear you say so. I’ll be around in
another week, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be in a hurry to get well,” said
Sam with a grin. “If I had a chance in here I’d
make it last as long as possible.”</p>

<p>Sam looked at the comfortable bed, in the spotlessly
spick and span room, glanced at a tray of
delicacies at Tom’s side, thought of his own strenuous
life, and grinned again.</p>

<p>“I sure would draw it out as long as possible,”
he went on. “No beastly reveille to wake you
up mornings.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can lie here and think of you fellows
hitting the trail,” said Tom. “But it isn’t all
velvet at that. I’m as sore as a boil.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so. Say, the work is as hard
as bullets now. You may well be glad you’re out
of it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll only have that much more to make up,”
Tom said, with a sigh. “I’m going to bone a
little while I’m here, though.”</p>

<p>Tom’s two other chums came in later, and then
he fell into a day-sleep, from which he awoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
much refreshed. The orderly approached his
bed, saying:</p>

<p>“One of the janitors has been asking for you,
Mr. Taylor. He’s been here a number of times,
but you were engaged or asleep. He’s just come
again. Will you see him?”</p>

<p>“One of the janitors?” repeated Tom, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Flack. He’s assigned to the officers’
quarters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know him.” Flack was an old soldier
who had become crippled from rheumatism,
and had been assigned some light tasks about the
Academy. Tom had done him a number of slight
favors, and the man seemed unusually grateful.</p>

<p>“Let him come up,” Tom said, feeling quite
touched by this mark of liking on the part of one
of the subordinates. Tom had quite forgotten
that Flack felt under obligations to him.</p>

<p>“I’ll bring him,” the orderly said.</p>

<p>Flack came in limping, yet with a trace of his
former soldierly uprightness. On his wrinkled
face, twisted by the drawing pains of rheumatism,
there was a cheery smile.</p>

<p>“My, but I’m sorry to see you in this shape,
Mr. Taylor, sir,” said the janitor. “Very
sorry,” and he saluted.</p>

<p>“Oh, it might be worse,” Tom said. “Have a
chair,” and he indicated one near the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“No, I won’t stay,” Flack answered. “I just
came to bring you something.” He gave a quick
look around, and noting that the orderly had left
the room, the janitor pulled a folded paper from
his pocket. Tom noted that the document consisted
of several torn scraps, pasted together with
strips of transparent paper.</p>

<p>“This has your name on it—or at least the
name Taylor,” Flack went on. “I thought it
might be valuable, so I’ve been saving it for you.”</p>

<p>He laid down on the bed in front of Tom a
copy of the trust deed, and walked away.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br><span class="small">THE CLUE</span></h2></div>


<p>For the moment Tom was so surprised that he
did not move. He lay there, looking at the curiously
pasted-together document, so strangely restored
to him. Flack was on his way out of the
room. Then Tom realized he must know more
about the matter.</p>

<p>“I say, Flack—wait a moment!” he called
after the janitor.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Just a minute. Come here. Where did you
get this?”</p>

<p>Flack did not answer at once. He approached
the bed, looked carefully around to see that no
one was within hearing, and leaning over, whispered:</p>

<p>“I got it out of his waste-paper basket.”</p>

<p>“Whose?” asked Tom, though he knew well
enough.</p>

<p>“The man that run you down, Mr. Taylor,
sir. I got it out of Captain Hawkesbury’s waste-paper
basket.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said Tom. He hoped the matter was
straightforwardly done—sneaking tactics were
not tolerated at West Point. Still the document
was Tom’s own. But after his interview with the
old army officer he had been so discouraged about
the matter that he had not cared what had become
of the trust deed. Now it had come back to
him.</p>

<p>“I clean up around Captain Hawkesbury’s
quarters, Mr. Taylor, sir,” went on Flack.
“When I was emptying his basket some time back
I saw this torn paper drop out. I didn’t pay much
attention to it until I saw the name Charles Taylor.
I thought of you, though that isn’t your
name; is it—I mean your first name?”</p>

<p>“It’s my father’s,” Tom answered, as he saw
where Mr. Taylor’s name appeared in the paper.</p>

<p>“Ah, that accounts for it then,” the janitor
said. “Well, when I saw the name Taylor I
looked further and got all the pieces. Then I
pasted ’em together. I was going to bring it to
you, thinking maybe you had lost it, though I
couldn’t figure how it got in his basket.”</p>

<p>Tom did not think it wise to illuminate the
janitor on that point. Flack went on.</p>

<p>“I was going to give it to you before, but I
got laid up with the rheumatics, and I didn’t want
to trust it to any one else. Then you got laid up
yourself, Mr. Taylor, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” Tom assented with a smile, “I’m laid
up all right.”</p>

<p>“So I brought it as soon as they’d let me see
you,” concluded the old soldier, “and I hope it’ll
be of value to you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, very much,” Tom answered. “I
have no doubt but that it will. I’m obliged to
you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” Flack said. “Sure you
did me enough favors. It’s time I paid some of
’em back. He was quite anxious to get it himself,”
and he jerked his head in the direction of
the officers’ quarters.</p>

<p>“Who was anxious to get it?” Tom wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“Captain Hawkesbury, sir. He come to me
the day after I’d taken the basket from his room,
and asked to have all his litter brought back. He
said he’d mislaid some valuable documents. I
didn’t let on anything, but I gave him a bag of
papers where I had emptied his basket. That
wasn’t among ’em, though,” and he pointed to
the pasted deed on Tom’s bed.</p>

<p>“I’d taken that out beforehand,” Flack said,
with a very human wink. “And as it had your
name on it before it had Captain Hawkesbury’s,
I thought you had the best right to it.”</p>

<p>“I have,” Tom said. “Thank you very much.”</p>

<p>He was fired with new energy now. If the document<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
was valuable enough to cause the old army
officer to make such an effort to get it back, Tom
was glad he himself had it again.</p>

<p>“The captain was quite put out when he
brought back the papers he’d looked over,” went
on Flack. “He asked me if I was sure there
weren’t any more. I gave him all the refuse I
had in the cellar, for I only burn the papers once
a week. He went over it all, and pretty dusty and
dirty he got, too. But he didn’t find it. I took
good care of that.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you did,” Tom replied. “It’s quite
a complicated matter,” he went on. “Captain
Hawkesbury is mistaken in thinking this paper is
his. It belongs to me.”</p>

<p>The young cadet did not want Captain Hawkesbury
to stand in too bad a light before the janitor,
and that was why he made the qualifying statement
he did. There was time enough yet to prove
certain points.</p>

<p>Flack went out, leaving Tom in a rather bewildered
state of mind. One fact stood out clearly.
The document must have suddenly assumed
new importance to justify Captain Hawkesbury’s
making such an effort to regain possession of it.
He had torn it up in a fit of anger and thrown it
in the basket.</p>

<p>“Evidently he was going to let it stay there,”
Tom reasoned. “Then something came up that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
made him want to get it back. Now what could
that have been? And why is this paper of any
value?”</p>

<p>Tom looked at it carefully. He knew pretty
well the contents of it. The trust deed was of
the usual character. The location of the land,
on which stood one end of the big railroad bridge,
was given in feet, chains, links, and by degrees—in
the manner in which all descriptions of property
are made, “beginning at a point,” and so on.</p>

<p>But, somehow now, the dull details took on
a new interest for Tom. The draft of the deed
recited how the land was not to be in the possession
of Captain Hawkesbury and Mr. Doolittle,
but was to be in their hands to insure a better
settlement from the railroad. The proceeds were
to be turned over to Mr. Taylor, or his heirs and
assigns. At that time, of course, Tom’s father
was in perfect health, but all deeds and such instruments
recite that the property goes to a certain
person, and his heirs and assigns.</p>

<p>“Now what gets me,” Tom mused as he lay
there in bed, “is why the captain wanted this
paper so badly after he threw it away. I feel
sure he thought as I did, at the time I had the
talk with him. He felt that it wasn’t worth bothering
with and I did also. But I feel differently
now.”</p>

<p>Tom folded the document and put it under his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
pillow. He felt better than at any time since
having been brought to the hospital.</p>

<p>“I want to get up and do something!” Tom
told himself. And that feeling did more toward
hastening his recovery than all the doctor’s medicine.</p>

<p>“My! This is an improvement!” exclaimed
the medical man, when Tom was found sitting up
on the occasion of the first visit after Flack’s call.
“You look a whole lot better!”</p>

<p>“And I feel a whole lot better!” Tom said,
eagerly. “When may I get out of bed, Doctor?”</p>

<p>“Pretty soon now. I guess we’ve eliminated
any possibility of an internal injury. You can get
up and walk as soon as it doesn’t hurt you too
much to move. I expect, though, that you’re going
to be lame and stiff for some time yet.”</p>

<p>Tom was. It was agony to get out of bed for
the first time, but he persisted, knowing that the
sooner he began to use his muscles and joints the
more quickly would they limber up, and lose their
soreness and stiffness.</p>

<p>The time came when Tom could leave the hospital
and walk about. His chums rejoiced with
him. He was not wholly discharged, however,
and still kept his hospital bed as his sleeping
place.</p>

<p>“But I’ll be with you inside of a week,” he told</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what I want to hear!” his chum exclaimed.</p>

<p>Tom was rather apprehensive about the first
meeting with Captain Hawkesbury. He wondered
how the old army officer would behave toward
him, and if he would make any mention of
the missing deed.</p>

<p>It was on the day when the physician first said
Tom could leave the hospital for good, and return
to his own quarters, that our hero met the
captain.</p>

<p>It was while on his way to his own room that
Tom saw, coming toward him, the man with whom
he had collided. And at the sight of our hero,
walking with just the least suspicion of a limp,
the face of the old army officer took on a deeper
tint of red.</p>

<p>Tom saluted as he passed, but was a little diffident
about speaking first.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you’re out of the hospital, eh?” the
captain said, and there was no kindness, but a
sneer in his voice. “The next time you ride try
and keep your horse under better control” he
said, sharply. “We might have both been seriously
hurt. Luckily I know how to take a fall.”</p>

<p>He seemed to think only of himself, as if he
were the only person concerned. He did not take
into consideration the fact that Tom <i>had</i> been
hurt. There were no chances in his case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“I could not help it, Captain Hawkesbury,”
Tom said, firmly. “It was not my fault—altogether,”
he added, significantly.</p>

<p>“It was rank carelessness!” was the snapped-out
retort.</p>

<p>Then, turning on his heel, the captain marched
away, not answering Tom’s parting salute. The
old army officer was very insulting in tone and
manner, but Tom was not going to let that annoy
him.</p>

<p>“Welcome home!” exclaimed Sam, as his
chum came in. “It’s good to see you back again!”</p>

<p>“It’s good to be back,” Tom replied, with a
smile, as they shook hands. “You’re all decorated
in honor of my return,” he went on whimsically,
as he glanced at the bare walls of the
room.</p>

<p>“Good joke!” laughed Sam. “Oh, I’d have
decorated all right, if ‘tac’ would stand for it.
But you know how it is here.”</p>

<p>“I sure do!” agreed Tom.</p>

<p>For Tom, matters soon resumed their normal
sway at West Point. He had to make up what he
had lost in his lessons, but he managed to do this,
and soon he was back in the saddle again, literally
as well as figuratively, for he was riding once
more, though a different steed from the one that
had figured in the accident.</p>

<p>All the while Tom was trying to plan how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
find out more about his father’s property. He
had drawn up a letter to be sent to Mr. Blasdell,
the lawyer, but the young cadet was not quite
satisfied with his epistle, and was going to rewrite
it.</p>

<p>He was on his way to call on young Blasdell, to
get a few points in this matter, when, as Tom
passed the room of Captain Hawkesbury, he saw,
standing near the open window of the quarters
of the old army officer, Sam Leland. The latter
seemed to be looking at a scrap of paper that he
had picked up from the ground.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom!” he exclaimed. “This just
came fluttering by, and I picked it up. It’s part
of a telegram, but the address is torn off, and I
don’t know to whom it belongs. It’s been thrown
away, evidently. Take a look.”</p>

<p>“A telegram?”</p>

<p>“It looks like it to me. Take a squint at it
yourself,” added Sam, after a pause.</p>

<p>He passed it to Tom, who saw, in a flash, these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Too bad he knows about draft—sorry you
lost track of it. Better come to Garrison at once
and consult with me. Will wait for you at same
hotel I always stop at.”</p>
</div>

<p>Tom could not comprehend for a moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
but when he saw signed to the torn telegram the
name Aaron Doolittle, it all came to him in a
flash.</p>

<p>“I believe this is the clue I need!” Tom said
aloud.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br><span class="small">IN GARRISON</span></h2></div>


<p>Sam looked at his chum a moment as if wondering
whether he had heard aright. Tom continued
to stare at the crumpled and torn telegram.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Tom?” his
chum asked. “What are you talking about clues
for? Been reading some detective stories?”</p>

<p>“No, but this is a clue all right. Where did
you get it?”</p>

<p>“Found it right here on the ground. I picked
it up—” he paused to look at the open window
of Captain Hawkesbury’s room. “Why, say!” Sam
exclaimed, “it must have come from there!”</p>

<p>“I think so,” Tom agreed.</p>

<p>“Wind probably blew it out,” went on Sam.
“We can toss it back I suppose, though evidently
it was intended to be thrown away.”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t toss it back,” Tom said, quietly.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with it?”</p>

<p>“Keep it. Just as I said, I think it’s a valuable
clue to the puzzle I’m working on,” and Tom put
the torn paper in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“Say, you’ve got me going!” Sam said.
“Elucidate a bit for a fellow.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Tom, “but not here. Come
along where we can have a quiet talk. This may
be important.”</p>

<p>Tom put his chum in possession of all the facts
in the case, from the time of his father’s death
and the property tangle, to the return of the draft
of the trust deed by Flack, the janitor.</p>

<p>“And you think Doolittle and Hawkesbury
kept for themselves the money they received from
the railroad?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>“That’s what I believe, though I don’t know
how I’m going to prove it. However, this telegram
may help some.”</p>

<p>“How do you think that figures in it?” asked
Sam.</p>

<p>“Well, this is only a theory, of course,” Tom
replied, “but it seems reasonable. Something
cropped up after the captain threw away the deed
I showed him, that made him want to get it back
again. We know how that plan failed.</p>

<p>“Then, evidently, he told Aaron Doolittle
about the matter, and Doolittle, too, had reason
to want to see that draft of the deed in their own
possession. You see he states in his telegram that
it is too bad I know about the existence of the
paper and he is sorry about its loss. There must
be something important back of it all when Doolittle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
wants to meet the captain in Garrison, across
the river.”</p>

<p>“I’m beginning to think you’re on the right
track, Tom,” said Sam.</p>

<p>“Of course, I don’t know when this telegram
was received,” Tom went on, “and it may be that
the captain is, even now, in Garrison, talking with
Doolittle. If he is I wish I could be there too.”</p>

<p>“Captain Hawkesbury isn’t in Garrison now,”
Sam told his chum, “for I saw him, a little while
ago, going over to the Com’s quarters.”</p>

<p>“Well, he may already have had his talk,”
Tom went on. “If we only knew the date the
message was delivered I would know a little better
where I was at.”</p>

<p>“That ought to be easy,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“What ought?”</p>

<p>“Finding out when this message came. We
can interview the boy at the office who delivered
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. All’s fair in a war of this kind,
when I’m trying to establish my mother’s rights,”
decided Tom. “We’ll see what we can find out.”</p>

<p>By judicious inquiries of the delivery lad, they
learned that the telegram had come in only a few
hours before Sam found the torn scrap.</p>

<p>“That settles it then,” Tom said; “he hasn’t
kept the Garrison appointment yet, and I’ve got
a chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” his chum asked,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try and be in Garrison, at the
hotel, when Captain Hawkesbury and Aaron Doolittle
have their conference,” was the reply. “I’m
going to try to hear what they say. It isn’t just
my usual style of doing things, but it can’t be
helped.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Sam, “it’s fair enough to get
evidence that way against men of that character.
The only thing is, though, can you make it work?”</p>

<p>“I can try,” Tom said.</p>

<p>“It’s going to take some pretty good planning,”
Sam went on. “You’ll have to leave here soon
after the captain does, and follow him. It’s going
to be risky.”</p>

<p>“Anything is that’s worth while.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Well, I’ll help you all I can, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, old man. I was hoping you would
offer. And I’d like to have you go to Garrison
with me in case we get a chance.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that, too. Now let’s go all over the
ground, and see if we’ve left our flank unguarded
anywhere. We’ve got to make this a sort of
ambushed attack at first, until we see how strong
the enemy really is. So we’ll do a little mental
scouting in advance.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Tom. “Anybody would think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
if they didn’t know you, that you knew a little
about military matters.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t they!” laughed Sam.</p>

<p>Together they went over the matter point by
point, and bit by bit. There was much dependent
on chance, of course, but that could not be helped.
The success of the whole plan lay in finding out
when Captain Hawkesbury went to Garrison to
keep the appointment with Aaron Doolittle.
Then would come the matter of following him.</p>

<p>“It will be soon, I’m thinking,” Tom said.
“He wouldn’t wait long on such an important
matter as that. He may go over this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“It will be easy for us if he does,” Sam said.
“We can get leave of absence more easily now
than almost any other time.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Tom, who was thinking deeply.</p>

<p>It was not so difficult as it might seem at first
glance, to find out when Captain Hawkesbury
left the Academy. The goings and comings of
the military men, as well as those of the cadets,
was governed more or less by rules and regulations.
Tom thought he could find out within a
few minutes after the captain had left.</p>

<p>To do this he had to get the information from
one of the servants employed in the building
where the Captain had his quarters. But Tom
was not going to stop at a little thing like that at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
this stage of the proceedings. Accordingly he
made his plan.</p>

<p>“We’d better ask for permission now, to be
absent this afternoon in case we want to,” suggested
Sam. “It’s well to provide for the emergency
in advance.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Tom agreed.</p>

<p>There was no trouble on this score. As members
of the third class they were entitled to more
privileges than came to the poor “plebes.”</p>

<p>“Now about getting over the river,” went on
Sam, when that much had been done. “How are
you going to manage that?”</p>

<p>“We can easily hire a motor boat,” Tom declared,
“and get one to bring us back.”</p>

<p>“Another thing—we don’t know at what hotel
Doolittle will stop.”</p>

<p>“There are only two where he would be likely
to stop,” Tom said, “and we can try both of
those.”</p>

<p>“Well, that much is settled. But it isn’t going
to be so easy to get in a position to hear what
they’ll talk about.”</p>

<p>“I realize that,” Tom said, “and, as we can’t
plan that ahead, we’ll just have to trust to luck.
Somehow or other I think it’s going to be on my
side. Things are coming my way. Here is the
copy of the deed restored to me, and then you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
hand me the telegram that gives me the very clue
I want. Yes, I think I’m playing in luck.”</p>

<p>“I hope it continues,” remarked Sam.</p>

<p>Tom gave up his plan of seeing young Blasdell,
at least for the present. Now all depended on
the move Captain Hawkesbury would make.</p>

<p>Events happened more quickly than Tom had
expected, though he was just as glad they did.
Nervous waiting is about the most tiresome thing
there is.</p>

<p>Shortly after dinner, when the limited freedom
Tom and Sam had secured went into effect, Tom
received word that Captain Hawkesbury had left
his quarters, in civilian’s dress.</p>

<p>“That means he’s going!” cried Tom. “Are
you with me, Sam?”</p>

<p>“I sure am! We’ll go to Garrison right
away.”</p>

<p>They managed to follow Captain Hawkesbury
without being observed. He took a motor boat,
evidently one he had arranged for in advance,
as it carried no other passengers. When it was
part way across the river Tom and Sam engaged
another, and after a short run they found themselves
in the city where Tom and Clarence had
had their affair two years before.</p>

<p>“And now to try the hotels,” suggested Sam,
as he and his chum started up the street.</p>

<p>“Right you are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe he didn’t go to any hotel. He may
have some friend to visit,” continued Sam, struck
by a sudden idea.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that, Sam. But we have got to
take our chances. Come ahead. You know what
I said about hotels here.” And thus speaking our
hero led the way.</p>

<p>The hardest part of their task lay before them.
What would be the outcome?</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br><span class="small">DISCOVERED</span></h2></div>


<p>Tom had remarked to Sam, when discussing
the matter of trying to discover what was going
on between Captain Hawkesbury and Mr. Doolittle,
that there were at that time only two hotels
in Garrison where it was likely the meeting would
take place. One hostelry was not far from the
dock at which the two cadets landed, and they
stopped at this one first.</p>

<p>“Better take a look around,” suggested Sam,
as they approached the hotel. “The captain
might be in the corridor, or outside somewhere,
on the lookout for us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he suspects anything,” Tom
said, “but, at the same time, it is well to be on the
watch.”</p>

<p>Accordingly they looked carefully up and
down the street. There was no sign of the old
army officer.</p>

<p>Tom and Sam also glanced cautiously about
the corridor as they approached the hotel desk.
Just what their plans would be, in case they found
Mr. Doolittle stopping there, neither could say.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
As Tom had remarked, they might be forced to
invent something on the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>“Mr. Doolittle, no, he isn’t stopping here,”
the clerk said, as he nodded to the cadets. He
knew where they were from, of course. A single
look at their erect carriage and their alert, soldierly
manner, told that.</p>

<p>“Then he must be over at the other place,” said
Tom. He knew the clerk would have no reason
for deceiving him, but of course Mr. Doolittle
might have requested that his name be kept off
the register—at least for a time.</p>

<p>Tom thought of this.</p>

<p>“You know Mr. Doolittle, of Chester?” he
asked the man behind the desk.</p>

<p>“Yes, he has stopped here occasionally, but of
late I understand he has taken his patronage elsewhere,”
the clerk said, with a smile. “As a matter
of fact, personally, I am not sorry,” he went
on. “He was, if you’ll excuse my saying so—”</p>

<p>He appeared to hesitate, as though he did not
want to make a slighting remark in case Tom and
his chum were friends of the man in question.</p>

<p>“Oh, go as far as you like,” laughed Sam.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a big crank, that’s the worst I
could say of him,” declared the clerk. “He
made my life miserable with his complaints and
his wants. I’m glad he was wished on some other
hotel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>There was no question now as to the clerk’s
aiding Mr. Doolittle in keeping secret his visit
to this hotel. He must be at the other one.</p>

<p>Thanking the clerk for his information, Tom
and Sam left to make another call. The second
hotel was in the business section of the city, but
within walking distance, and the two chums soon
found themselves nearing it.</p>

<p>“Go a bit easy,” suggested Sam.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed his chum.</p>

<p>They looked up and down the street. No person
resembling Captain Hawkesbury was in sight.
Nor could Mr. Doolittle be seen.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s make a stab at it,” suggested Tom,
rather desperately, and they entered.</p>

<p>There was no need to ask the hotel clerk if
Mr. Doolittle was a guest. The register was
open and swung around facing them, having been
left so when a man, who preceded Tom and Sam,
put down his name in the book. And there,
among the other signatures, was that of Aaron
Doolittle.</p>

<p>“He’s here, Sam,” said Tom, quickly, but in a
low voice.</p>

<p>“Is he? That’s good. Well, what’s the next
move?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I want to think. Let’s go to
a quiet place and sit down.”</p>

<p>The clerk saw the two cadets standing near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
book. He dipped the pen in the ink, and held it
out to them suggestively.</p>

<p>“Do you want single rooms, or a double one?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Neither one,” answered our hero, with a
smile. “We came to see Mr. Doolittle,” he
added, quickly making up his mind to a certain
plan. “Is he in?”</p>

<p>The clerk turned to look at the key rack.</p>

<p>“He’s out,” he answered. “I remember now,
he went out a little while ago.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me where?” Tom pursued. “It’s
rather important,” he added, seeing the clerk
hesitate.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, he left word where he could be
found,” the clerk said. “He stated that he was
expecting rather an important telegram, and I
am to send it to him. You’re not by any chance
the telegram, are you?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Tom, smiling, “but I have
something important to communicate to Mr. Doolittle.”
That statement was certainly true.</p>

<p>“You’ll find him at Lawyer Royse’s office,”
the clerk said. “It’s two blocks up the street, on
the other side. Mr. Doolittle went there with
Captain Hawkesbury a little while ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Tom, quickly. “Thank
you. I’ll call on him there at once. Come on,
Sam,” he added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“What’s the game?” his chum asked him in a
low voice, as they left the hotel.</p>

<p>“This,” replied Tom, rapidly. “They have
evidently gone to a lawyer’s office to fix up some
game. Matters must have developed and be
going against them. They’re afraid!”</p>

<p>“But what can you do at the lawyer’s office?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—I’m not sure. But I know
this Mr. Royse by reputation. He stands very
high in his profession. I feel sure if Doolittle
and the captain asked him to do something that
was not right, even though it was strictly legal, he
would refuse.”</p>

<p>“You mean he wouldn’t take their case and
try to keep that money away from your mother?”</p>

<p>“That’s it. I’m going to appeal to Mr. Royse,
after Doolittle and the captain get through, tell
him the whole story, and ask him to do the square
thing.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but that’s a good plan, Tom.
I’m with you. Come along.”</p>

<p>They hurried up the street toward the lawyer’s
office. As yet they had not seen the captain or
Mr. Doolittle, though they realized that either
of the two men might have observed them, and
be on their guard. But they must take some
chances.</p>

<p>“This is the place,” Tom said, as they halted
in front of an office building “Now for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>They mounted the stairs, a directory on the
lower floor telling them that the offices of Mr.
Royse were on the second story. At the head of
the second flight they saw a door, with a ground-glass
panel on which was painted the lawyer’s
name, and the word “Entrance.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go in?” asked Sam.</p>

<p>Tom hesitated a moment and then took a desperate
resolve.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “we’ll face ’em both if they’re
in there. I’ve got to end this suspense. Let’s
go in.”</p>

<p>They opened the door. To their surprise the
room was vacant. There was a litter of papers
and dirt on the floor, but not so much as a chair
or desk. The room opened into another, and
that was equally bare.</p>

<p>“Why—why!” gasped Tom, blankly.</p>

<p>“He’s moved out,” Sam said. At the same
time he picked up from the floor, near the entrance,
a small card. On this card it was stated
that Mr. Royse had moved his offices up one
flight.</p>

<p>“This card was stuck in the door,” said Sam.
“It fell out. He must have moved up recently.
Shall we go up?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tom, “I guess we—”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly. Both he and Sam heard
a murmur of voices, and then came one in louder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
tones. They both recognized the accent of Captain
Hawkesbury.</p>

<p>“Where does that sound come from?” Tom
whispered.</p>

<p>Silently Sam pointed to the ceiling. There
was a hole, evidently cut for a stove pipe, or for
ventilation. The building was an old one. The
hole in the ceiling went through the floor in the
present offices of the lawyer. It made a perfect
sounding device.</p>

<p>As Tom and Sam listened, they could hear
plainly all that was said in the room above. Tom
recognized the voices of Captain Hawkesbury
and Mr. Doolittle. The other voice he judged
to be that of the lawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. Doolittle was speaking.</p>

<p>“And so you see,” he stated, “we must do
something, now that Tom is approaching the age
set in the trust deed. Of course Captain Hawkesbury
and I realize that it is a ticklish legal proceeding,
but we are willing to pay well for what
you can do. I will not give up the money. I
worked hard enough for it, and if it had not been
for me the railroad company never would have
bought Taylor’s land.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I helped put the deal through,” said
the captain. “I am going to keep my share from
that little whiffet! I’ll break him yet! Can you
help us out, Mr. Royse? It’s too bad I haven’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the draft of that trust deed, but perhaps we can
do without it.”</p>

<p>“Now let me understand the situation, gentlemen,”
said the voice of the third speaker, evidently
the lawyer.</p>

<p>Tom clapped his hand on Sam’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“We’ve discovered ’em!” he exclaimed exultingly.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br><span class="small">RESTITUTION</span></h2></div>


<p>Softly Sam crossed the room and closed the
door. This left him and Tom alone and unobserved
in the vacant offices formerly occupied by
Mr. Royse. The closing of the door also enabled
them to hear more plainly, as it shut out
noises from the street.</p>

<p>“Just state your case, Mr. Doolittle,” said the
lawyer. “And be as brief as possible, as I am
very busy.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s this way,” began Mr. Doolittle.
He then went into details concerning the business
relations he had had with Tom’s father. Much
of this was new to Tom, but some was an old
story. In a way, however, it revealed to him
that his father had trusted Mr. Doolittle and
Captain Hawkesbury a great deal farther than
was prudent. It also revealed the fact that Mr.
Taylor had larger business dealings than Tom
had suspected.</p>

<p>Most of what Mr. Doolittle related was strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
businesslike—sharp practice, perhaps, but nothing
criminal in it. Tom waited anxiously for
some reference to the railroad land—that on
which stood one end of the big bridge.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Doolittle, with Captain Hawkesbury
putting in a word or two, came to that. It
was a complicated transaction. Mr. Taylor did
owe some money to the two conspirators, but they
could have paid themselves by the sale of a much
less valuable piece of property than that along
the river where the railroad was sure to come.</p>

<p>“But we thought we had a right to make as
much as we could, since we took the risks,” Mr.
Doolittle said.</p>

<p>“Then, as I understand it,” the lawyer put in,
“you destroyed the real deed of trust—”</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t exactly destroy it,” said Captain
Hawkesbury, “but we didn’t put it on file.”</p>

<p>“It’s the same thing!” exclaimed the lawyer.
“In other words, you converted this property to
your own uses.”</p>

<p>“We sold it to the railroad,” Mr. Doolittle
admitted.</p>

<p>“And now, since a complication has arisen, and
since the railroad has made a demand on you to
show them better authority than you have hitherto
shown as owners and sellers of this land, you want
me to take your case and help you out of a dilemma;
is that it?” asked Mr. Royse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“That’s it,” said Mr. Doolittle, eagerly. “We
hear you are the best corporation lawyer in these
parts, and so the captain and I planned to come
to you. I don’t mind admitting that the railroad
lawyer has made me nervous.”</p>

<p>“Will you take the case?” asked Captain
Hawkesbury. “We will pay you well. You had
better give him a retaining fee now, Mr. Doolittle.”</p>

<p>“He had better do nothing of the kind,” said
Mr. Royse, with unexpected energy.</p>

<p>“Wha—what?” stammered Mr. Doolittle,
and though Tom and Sam could only hear through
the ventilation opening, and could not see, still
they could fancy the look of surprise on the face
of the crabbed, wealthy man. “Won’t you take
a retaining fee? It’s usual.”</p>

<p>“Not with me—in a case like this.”</p>

<p>“You mean you don’t want a retaining fee?”
asked Captain Hawkesbury.</p>

<p>“I mean I don’t want your case!” exclaimed
the lawyer. “I would not handle such a case! It
is little—if anything—short of criminal!”</p>

<p>“Be careful!” blurted out the captain.</p>

<p>“It is you who had better be careful,” said
the lawyer. “I don’t want your case—no decent
member of the bar would. In fact I am not sure
but what I ought to proceed against you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare!” cried Mr. Doolittle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not afraid,” was the retort. “The
only question is about getting the evidence against
you. If I knew this young Tom Taylor—”</p>

<p>“You’re going to know him, and very soon,”
said Tom in a whisper to his chum, as, with a
grim smile on his face, he started toward the
door.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>“Up there to face them,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“It is nothing short of taking the money the
railroad company paid for the land, and using it
yourselves,” the lawyer went on. “The money
should go to Mr. Taylor’s widow and his son. If
I knew him—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare proceed against us!” cried
Mr. Doolittle. “If you try to make use of the
information we gave you I’ll have you disbarred.
You don’t dare!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes I do dare,” was the calm assurance.
“In fact I have just made up my mind that I will
endeavor to find this young man and his mother,
and see what I can do to make restitution to them.
I feel that I would be concealing a crime if I did
not. I wish I could see this Tom Taylor—”</p>

<p>“You’re going to see him!” exclaimed Tom.
“Come on, Sam!”</p>

<p>He fairly jumped up the stairs, three at a time,
Sam following. At the head of the second flight
was a door similar to the one they had first entered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
Without knocking, Tom entered. He
came at a dramatic moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Doolittle and Captain Hawkesbury had
arisen, and were facing the lawyer. Mr. Royse
was a big man, and he remained seated. It was
easy to see that he was not at all alarmed. Righteous
indignation showed in his face. At the entrance
of Tom and Sam the two conspirators
faced about suddenly.</p>

<p>“You—here?” gasped Mr. Doolittle.</p>

<p>“Tom Taylor!” echoed Captain Hawkesbury.
“How dare you leave the Academy?” he demanded,
too flustered, evidently, to return the
salute which Tom and Sam gave with military
precision.</p>

<p>“We have a permit, Captain Hawkesbury,”
Tom said, calmly. “I beg your pardon, sir,” he
went on to the lawyer, “but I accidentally overheard
you express a wish to see me.”</p>

<p>“To see you? I’m afraid I haven’t the honor
of—”</p>

<p>“I’m Tom Taylor, a cadet at the United States
Military Academy,” Tom said. “It is my father’s
land those two men sold to the railroad,” and
he pointed an accusing finger.</p>

<p>“Here’s a copy of the trust deed they spoke of,
or, rather, a rough draft of it,” he went on, putting
on the desk in front of the lawyer the pasted
paper that had so strangely come back to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Oh—ah!” said Mr. Royse, seemingly rather
at a loss to know what action to take.</p>

<p>“Will you act for me—for my mother?” Tom
went on, eagerly. “I can’t pay you a big retaining
fee, but I understand it is sometimes the practice
for lawyers to take cases like this on a contingency
fee basis.”</p>

<p>“It is done every day,” Mr. Royse said. “I
shall look into this matter—”</p>

<p>“If you dare take up this case, and proceed
against us,” fairly shouted Mr. Doolittle, “I’ll
have you—I’ll have you—”</p>

<p>Captain Hawkesbury touched his companion on
the arm.</p>

<p>“We had better go to see another lawyer,” he
suggested.</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” said Mr. Royse, dryly,
“though I doubt if you can get a reputable one
to take up your case. Good afternoon. You will
probably hear from me very soon,” he added, significantly.</p>

<p>Mr. Doolittle opened his mouth, as though to
splutter out some angry words, but Captain
Hawkesbury, with a vindictive look at Tom and
Sam, led his companion from the room.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s get down to business,” suggested
Mr. Royse, as Tom presented his chum, Sam.</p>

<p>Tom told his story quickly. It fitted in with
what he had heard through the ventilating hole,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
and he explained to the lawyer how it had come
about that the two cadets had followed the conspirators.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think, when I moved my office upstairs,
that I would get a case like this,” said the
lawyer. “But I’ll do my best for you, Tom.
Mind, I don’t promise anything, but it looks
very much as though your mother would get her
rights.”</p>

<p>“That’s all I want,” Tom said. “It will be a
big load off my shoulders to know that my
mother is provided for. And now what is the
next thing to do?”</p>

<p>“You may leave everything to me,” said the
lawyer. “I will at once start the ball rolling.”</p>

<p>“I—I’m not prepared to pay anything—now,”
Tom faltered.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t ask you to,” was the laughing answer.
“I turned down one retaining fee this
afternoon, so you may know I’m not suffering
financially. No, leave everything to me, and I’ll
communicate with you at West Point.”</p>

<p>“And that’s the place we’d better be heading
for on the double quick, Tom,” put in Sam. “If
we don’t hustle we’ll overstay our leave and that
may give Captain Hawkesbury a chance to skin
us.”</p>

<p>“I fancy he won’t do much more skinning,”
said Mr. Royse, significantly. “If I can bring this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
matter home to him it will be a bad mark against
him.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” Tom said, “but—”</p>

<p>“It’s best to have it all come out,” the lawyer
assured him.</p>

<p>Tom left the pasted copy of the trust deed with
Mr. Royse, and the two cadets reached West
Point just in time not to be reported. They saw
nothing of Captain Hawkesbury, and it became
known that night that he had left the Academy
on a two days furlough.</p>

<p>“Probably he and Doolittle have gone off to
try and stop the exposure,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“It looks that way,” Tom admitted.</p>

<p>Tom was so excited by what he had just gone
through that he did not sleep well that night. Nor
did he give the proper attention to his lessons the
next day. He made a failure and was given some
demerits. Events occurred rapidly during the
next few days. Mr. Royse was busy, sending
telegrams and letters, having lawyers in other
cities look up records, and in communicating with
the railroad company.</p>

<p>Captain Hawkesbury returned to West Point
glummer than ever, and “as mean as they make
’em,” to quote Sam Leland. He seemed to be
eagerly looking to catch Tom in some violation
of rules, that he might punish him. But Tom refrained
from taking part in any pranks during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
those perilous times, though several of his chums
took chances.</p>

<p>Then came the climax.</p>

<p>Mr. Royse sent Tom a telegram which read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Restitution will be made. Railroad company
has in trust large sum of money owing on land.
This will come to your mother and you. Can
also force Doolittle and Hawkesbury to pay back
all they wrongfully took. Charges to be preferred
against Captain Hawkesbury, of conduct unbecoming
an officer and a gentleman.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Tom, as he showed this to
Sam. “Things are certainly happening!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br><span class="small">GRADUATION</span></h2></div>


<p>Captain Hawkesbury did not wait for
charges to be preferred against him for his action
in keeping from Tom and Mrs. Taylor the
money due them. The old army officer had kept
secret his part in the transaction a long time, but
at last it came out. He resigned as instructor at
West Point, and also withdrew from the United
States service.</p>

<p>That was the end of Captain Hawkesbury,
and his nephew Clarence, too, as far as Tom was
concerned. The conspiring captain had made considerable
from his association with Mr. Taylor
and Mr. Doolittle, and some of his property was
legally attached for the benefit of Mrs. Taylor’s
claim.</p>

<p>Mr. Doolittle was wealthy, aside from the
money he had wrongfully obtained from the Taylor
estate. He defied Mr. Royse and Tom for a
time, but the threat of a legal suit brought him to
terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>Rather than take a chance in that he agreed to
pay back all he had taken, with interest. And
this, with what money the railroad company had
still held back, put Mrs. Taylor, in very easy circumstances.</p>

<p>“You won’t have to sew any more,” Tom
wrote to her, “and you can now afford to come to
West Point and see me graduate.”</p>

<p>For Tom’s graduation time was approaching.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that getting restitution
was as easy as it sounds. There was much legal
work to do, but Mr. Royse attended well to that.
It came out that the railroad company had not
been altogether satisfied with the land title Mr.
Doolittle and Captain Hawkesbury had given
them, so they retained a part of the price agreed
upon for the bridge approach, until a certain
time when the matter should be adjusted.</p>

<p>When that time came, they began to make inquiries
as to why their claim was not satisfied.
And it was this inquiry that complicated matters,
so that they eventually swung the way of Tom
and his mother.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad old Hawkesbury isn’t here
any more,” said Harry Houston one day as the
four chums were strolling about the grounds after
drill. “You deserve a vote of thanks, Tom, for
getting him out.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chimed in Chad Wilson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t get him out. He got himself
out,” Tom answered. “But I’m glad, too, that
he’s gone. We’ve got some stiff work ahead of
us, and he’d only make it all the harder for us.”</p>

<p>There was indeed hard work, but it was compensated
for when Tom and his chums finally got
into the first class—that is they were now beginning
their fourth, and final, year at West Point.
They now had many more privileges than at first.
They could leave camp when they liked, after
duty; they had first choice of horses and rooms—in
fact they were very superior beings compared
to the poor plebes.</p>

<p>Tom’s mother, now properly installed in a fine
home in Chester, came to see him, and he took
her about West Point, from Flirtation Walk to
Fort Putnam and Old Fort Clinton—to all the
places of interest—so that she enjoyed herself
very much. She was very proud of her son, and
Tom’s chums made much of his mother.</p>

<p>Tom devoted himself diligently to his studies.
Civil and military engineering formed a large
part, during that last year, and naturally gunnery
and ordnance were made much of. Tom had developed
into one of the best riders at the Academy,
and there were some daring and reckless ones.</p>

<p>It was an inspiring sight to see the first class
of seventy cadets charge at top gallop across the
gravel plain, sabres flashing in the sun. From a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
line near the hedge they would start toward the
chapel. Then, when the bugle blew, as they were
riding as if to charge an enemy, Tom and his fellow
riders would raise their sabres high in the
air, and yell “fit to split their throats.”</p>

<p>Then would come light artillery drill, with the
cannon rattling across the plain to be wheeled
into line and fired. The very horses seemed to
delight in the excitement and din, and certainly
Tom and his fellows enjoyed it.</p>

<p>June was approaching—Graduation June—when
Tom would leave West Point, to become a
second lieutenant in the regular army. One day
in February the gunner at Tom’s table made the
usual announcement of “One Hundred Days till
June.” And there was the usual rising to greet
the sun. Then came the “One Hundred Nights’
Entertainment,” a function replete with fun,
marking as it does the last cycle before the final
exercises. A play was given, Tom taking a girl’s
part with such effect that he was recalled again
and again.</p>

<p>But it was not all fun—that closing of the final
year. There was hard mental labor to be done
in order to pass the examinations, and Tom had
to work hard, as did his chums. Tom was trying
for high class honors, and stood a good chance
of winning them. Others were content to take
what they could get.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Tom made the acquaintance of some charming
young ladies, and had many a good time at the
hops and other entertainments that marked the
graduation period.</p>

<p>There were drills, parades and inspections. In
the riding hall each cadet tried to outdo the others
in skill and daring; in reckless riding with drawn
sabres, cutting at the leather heads on set-up
posts; in riding at the rings; in all the usual exploits.
Some rode bareback, others leaped hurdles,
still others rode two horses at once, standing
with one foot on the back of each.</p>

<p>“Well how about it, Tom, old man?” asked
Sam, as he met his chum after the last examination.
“Get through all right?”</p>

<p>“I hope so. How about you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess I managed to squeeze through.
I’m not trying to set a pace, like you.”</p>

<p>“Well I don’t know that I have set it, Sam,”
returned Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think you did.”</p>

<p>And so it proved, for when the final standings
were announced Tom Taylor was second man in
his class, first place going to a New York cadet,
who was a brilliant student, a first-class athlete
and one of the most popular men in his division.</p>

<p>Not that Tom lacked popularity. It was felt,
on the part of the cadets at least, that he was responsible
for the resignation of Captain Hawkesbury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
and this had endeared Tom to all, for the
old army officer was cordially hated.</p>

<p>When the examinations were over, and Tom
and the others realized they had not been
“found,” which would have meant that they had
actually “lost,” there was more freedom. There
was little to do save plan enjoyments, and these
were crowded in to the limit.</p>

<p>Tom was a good dancer, and he met many girl
friends of other cadets who were eager to have
him for a partner. Certainly Tom, in his natty
new uniform, was a partner of whom to be proud.</p>

<p>But all good things have an ending some time,
and it was so at West Point.</p>

<p>“Last parade!” announced Sam one day, as
he and Tom were dressing themselves for it.
“Last parade, old man!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Tom said. “And while there was a
time when I thought this would never come, now
that it is here I rather wish it wasn’t to be.”</p>

<p>“Same here. We’ll soon cut loose from old
West Point.”</p>

<p>To the tune “The Dashing White Sergeant,”
played only on certain occasions, the parade came
to an end. Tom and the others marched, with
bared heads, to the platform to receive a little
farewell talk from the commandant. Again Tom
heard, as he had when a plebe, the strains of
“Auld Lang Syne,” and “Home, Sweet Home.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
He felt a choking sensation in his throat. This
was the end of what, with all its hardships and
drawbacks, had been a wonderful four years.
Now he was to go out into the world to show what
he could do.</p>

<p>True, there was a place made for him, a place
of a sort, but he must depend on himself more
than ever now. He would be what he could make
himself. But he had had one of the best trainings
in the world with which to do it.</p>

<p>Following the little talk by the Commandant,
Tom and his fellows of the graduating class reviewed
the battalion as it marched past them.
Then they went to their barracks to preen for the
graduation hop that night. It was another wonderful
time for Tom Taylor.</p>

<p>The next morning the diplomas were to be
given out by the Secretary of War, while the
Academic Board, resplendent in brilliant uniforms,
looked on. They were now powerless
against the successful cadets, and they seemed to
grin cheerfully in acknowledging it.</p>

<p>There was more music, more marching to and
fro, more lines of severely straight young soldiers.
One by one the graduates went up to the platform,
and received the sheepskins which made
them commissioned officers in Uncle Sam’s army.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all over,” said Tom to Sam, as
they went to their room for the last time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“No, it’s only just beginning,” was the answer.
“From now on ought to be the best part of our
lives.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” Tom said. “Well, it’s a heap
sight happier for me than when I first came here.
I don’t have to worry about my mother now.”</p>

<p>“No, now that you got hold of the old army
officer’s secret, things are coming your way,”
agreed Sam.</p>

<p>The two chums planned to see each other that
summer before taking up their new duties.</p>

<p>“And now—good-bye, West Point,” said Tom,
softly, the next day, as he prepared to leave and
to meet his mother in Chester. “I hope all the
plebes will enjoy their stay as much as I did—after
I got over being one.”</p>

<p>“So say we all!” echoed Sam. “Good-bye,
West Point!”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
